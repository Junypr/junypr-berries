The first Wednesday of November shouldn't be this hot  
but the air boils with the rage of half a country wronged   
condensed into this microcosm of democracy   
--- if we can call it that anymore ---   
because when does the permission we gave    
with millions of penned-in circles   
become a mandate for something we never spoke?  
words drawn from the air that never passed our lips.  
<!-- TEASER_END -->
I am scared of what will be read in the silence of so many   
what gross shouts will become gunshots.   
some bear it better   
others let the darkness lurk behind hollow eye sockets  
my friend walks like he carries the world in his slim messenger bag   
stares out the window like the breeze whispers an answer   
we're scarred from the battle of blood red and bruise blue  
drawing defeat across the map of our country.   
the only thing that seems to unite us anymore is proximity.  
my mentor told me he needed a glass of wine   
and last night I laughed,  
because what's wine for four hours  
before I knew it would be four years  
the chef tells me to pray,  
and last night I would've sunk to my knees   
if I wasn't tired, if I wasn't godless,  
in the moments when we dreaded what was coming   
but clung to the hope  
that we might just awake   
and find our fears nightmares only   
the bus driver tells us that the sun will come up again   
and I watched it rise over these hallowed halls  
but does it rise when you've fallen through the cracks  
of a broken system,  
buried six feet under?  
we explain it away as if we already knew what would happen   
but didn't we promise?   
--- never again ---   
like eight years ago   
when I went to sleep hoping that it was a mirage   
only to see red when I awoke  
because we say it's fine, but we don't mean it, do we?
