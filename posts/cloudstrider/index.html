                <p><em>It started with a dying woman.</em></p>
<p><em>She stared from the hemp hammock with silver eyes matching mine. Except there wasn’t a star burning within, just the leaden shine of the three moons through the hut’s reed roof. She resembled me, it was true. The same abyssal hair flecked with stars, the same galaxial swirls dancing across her skin. Even the same flowing robes licked with violet flames, woven from the gasps of a dying star.</em></p>
<p><em>The villager with the sun-washed chest and shell-bead necklace smiled. “She told us to expect you.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Expect me?”</em></p>
<p>It started with darkness.</p>
<p>It’s dark in the space between the stars. It’s dark, and it’s cold, and it’s empty, and it’s where I go to clear my head. I float, where time and space freeze, watching the planets hum their endless melodies, watching newborn stars gasp their first breaths or dying ones scream their last. When I tire of the infinite lights, I close my eyes.</p>
<p>My name is Eva Cloudstrider, I mold the fabric of space and time, and I don’t know why I’m here. Maybe if I listen long enough, I’ll find out.</p>
<p>All I hear is a scream. A scream that winds around me until I’m caught in its embrace. A scream that tugs, ever stronger, until I take a step and time spins and spools and falls away. </p>
<p>I’m on a beach. The sand like stars again skin darker than the end of time, the waves a kiss upon milky cheeks. </p>
<p>The scream is louder.</p>
<p>The scream is death.</p>
<!-- TEASER_END -->

<p><em>“She’s dying,” he said.</em></p>
<p><em>“How can I save her?”</em></p>
<p>The water stings with the chill of the deep as I draw a ragged breath. The air in my lungs burns of salt and sand and scorching sun. I don’t need to breathe. I live on the light of the stars and the stars alone. When they flicker and fade for the last of their lives so too will I be gone. </p>
<p>The air in my lungs cleans the dust from my mind and the turquoise from this rusted world. The skyline is girdled by buildings, like a python’s coils around a heron. </p>
<p>The earth weeps the tears of a world beaten and broken and bruised. They fly through the crumbled arches and stagnant fountains and cracked mosaics, painting over the work of the people with nimble fingers. </p>
<p>The earth weeps not for her enchainment. Not for death that cradles her, awaiting her last gasping breath. But for the birds that no longer sing. The trees that no longer sigh. The winds that no longer hum as angels do. For the precious chord whose echoes have faded from her hallowed halls, and, now gone, can never be strummed again. </p>
<p>I too weep with tears that fall heavy like quicksilver before melting into the sea. </p>
<p><em>He sent me for the blood of a newborn star. I visited the nurseries, where they were tucked in quilts of glowing dust too vaporous to muffle their burbles.</em> </p>
<p><em>“I’m sorry,” I whispered, as I drained the liquid life. “Someone needs this.”</em></p>
<p><em>No one heard me leave.</em></p>
<p>Something mewls behind an acid-eaten concrete wall. A man — though he may not be a man — balances a child on his hip. He speaks in a tongue long forgotten yet intimately understood. Within the amber orbs of his eyes is the plea that does not need words.</p>
<p>A plea for help.</p>
<p>I shake my head. My inky hair tumbles in waves as if by shaking I can free the stars nestled in its curls. Even when I close my eyes to hide the still flowing tears I see the earth on her pyre and the people who chained her there.</p>
<p>Is this not what they deserved? The rightful death of the wrong?</p>
<p>I speak in the tongue most familiar, a language understood, not learned. He will not need words to know the sorrow in my eyes and the quick refusal on my lips.</p>
<p>His eyes are like a shard of crystal crushed in my palm.</p>
<p>The man speaks in a tongue newly learned and awkwardly phrased. “You are the promised one. The one she said would save us.”</p>
<p>“Who?”</p>
<p><em>They poured the blood of the newborn star into a basin at the foot of the cliffs, and let the three moon’s rays slice through until it shone like quicksilver. They filled a cup and placed it in my hands before I returned to the thatched roof hut.</em></p>
<p><em>Her eyes were closed. I poured the shimmering liquid down her throat, and listened to the thrum of her heart, in time with the waves. Her eyes fluttered open, and she smiled.</em></p>
<p><em>“It’s you. I knew you would come.”</em></p>
<p>The man’s eyes sparkle like amber caught in a beam of moonlight. His skin is chestnut brown and taut as he presses his lips. The words flow like sap. Sweet, nourishing, pure. </p>
<p>“Once, there were seers. A people gifted with sight, guiding us through the darkness. But then the old king died and left no heir, and the one the seers chose died too. Tybard seized the throne and seized their sight, twisted their words, their visions, their minds, locked them in his castle and threw away the key. Our people lost our way. Lost sight and mind and song.”</p>
<p>He presses the child close to his chest, reassuring himself of its reality. On the child’s hands are bright stars like those on my own. </p>
<p>“None escaped. Except one. Estela was gifted, more than so. Hers was the power to not just see but mold the fabric of life itself. She stole out of the castle to share her gift with this world. To give us sight. To guide the lost and scared and tired back to the light. </p>
<p>“She tried. But one alone cannot fix the world. So she said, ‘It takes one second to hurt. One millennium to heal.’” </p>
<p>He strokes the child’s head, and I see pure gold in her eyes. The gold of the heart of stars newly born, of a star before it had faded to silver.</p>
<p>“This is her child. But it is paradox for a seer and a plainsman to meet. Those who can see shall not be those that can shape the earth, so said. It’s miracle she’s alive. If she grows into her power, she will shine brighter than our star, and burn the same.</p>
<p>“Estela thought she could control her, but Tybard found her, seized her, slew her. And left me with this one I cannot save.”</p>
<p>The child has closed her eyes, and he replaces the veil over her head. </p>
<p>“The seers were gifted by one much like you. The Original. She visited us the day our child was born. She said you would come. She said you’d find her. To save us.”</p>
<p><em>“I know who you are, and why you’re here,” she whispered. “Do you?”</em></p>
<p><em>I pressed my hand to her chest, felt the pulse of her heart, the heat of the molten gold that flowed through her veins. “My name is Eva Cloudstrider. I’m here to save a planet.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Silly one, your name isn’t Cloudstrider. You are Eva, of the Cloudstriders.”</em></p>
<p>Barren day releases tender earth with a sigh, and allows gentle night to cover her in an ashen veil. Though earth sleeps, tears slip from her eyes. Though she dreams, she envisions ashes and storms and sorrow, and all her children, every living thing that calls her home, dreams of sorrow too. Dreams of drought and disease. Dreams of death.</p>
<p>In the darkness of a rusted sky the child’s eyes gleam. I see the future they see. I see famine. And flames. And floods. </p>
<p>No matter how many times I face death, the talons of darkness still draw tears from my eyes. Reason, though strong, can never fully dissuade. Some things simply break the heart.</p>
<p>I shouldn’t, but I say, “I give my aid, in any way that serves.” </p>
<p>I set off east, to where this woman might be.</p>
<p><em>“You are part of a once-proud people.” Her voice was no more tangible than spider’s silk. “A people who wove together space and time.”</em></p>
<p><em>“A people? Are there others?”</em></p>
<p><em>“I’m afraid that they’re nearly all gone. You may well be the last.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Me?”</em></p>
<p><em>“Little one, I won’t be here much longer. The blood of a newborn star may rejuvenate me, but only for a moment. When a Cloudstrider begins to fade, there is no cure.”</em></p>
<p><em>She coughed. Fractures split her velvet skin, revealing veins of gold.</em></p>
<p>Time is a tapestry beneath my fingers. The story of this world, written in silken threads. I feel it all. The weft, the weave, the fraying edges. With the lightest touch I can trace each thread from start to finish, tracing a life through its ups and downs, twists and turns and knots. </p>
<p>My eyes are blind to its colors. No matter how wide I spread my hands I can never see the full picture. Just trace one thread at a time. </p>
<p>I feel the thread that is myself. Gold that crackles beneath my touch, dancing through the tapestry. In a heartbeat I could skip from the beginning to the end of time. But I worry of the gash I’d leave. Bleeding gold over the delicate embroidery.</p>
<p>So I take the journey slowly. Step by step. </p>
<p><em>“Please,” I whisper. “Before you go. Save this planet.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Eva, I can’t.”</em></p>
<p>First is the marketplace. Stands built of driftwood, canopies of algae and seaweed and slime, fruit of bone bleached coral and writhing starfish, meat of jellyfish and eels. And the people — there are no people, but the ghosts of laughter and strange, almost sentient beings of fluttering plastic and scrap metal hearts. </p>
<p>I take another step.</p>
<p><em>“Why?”</em></p>
<p><em>Her eyes fluttered closed. “I can’t.”</em></p>
<p><em>“At least save the child.”</em></p>
<p>When my feet have traveled every path of the planet I close my eyes and take the first step away. My feet dance over pedestals of fog. I drift through time like the stars drift in their dances, intimately intertwined yet never brushing.</p>
<p>I walk slowly. I have so much time. So much time it kills me. </p>
<p><em>“Oh Eva.” She brought a hand to my cheek, and I felt the cold of star’s graves through her skin. “You know the child is safe. Don’t you remember me?”</em></p>
<p>I pass floating cities and colonists’ ships, planets of barren sand and planets of crystal. I pass graveyard worlds, and worlds untouched by death, searching for someone who looks like me.</p>
<p>It takes me centuries to find the village between the two cliffs. The trees and the birds and the waves whisper their welcome. The villagers place a wreath of flowers on my head and a necklace of shells around my neck, and lead me to a thatched roof hut.</p>
<p>She’s inside.</p>
<p><em>“Mother?”</em></p>
<p><em>“No, child. Estela’s your mother. I’m Chara. I raised you.”</em></p>
<p><em>“I don’t—”</em></p>
<p><em>She touched my cheek. I remembered.</em> </p>
<p>The fog and dust of time brush my feet. </p>
<p>I stand on the pedestal that Chara crafted just for this moment. For when I become a true Cloudstrider and begin to walk my own path. All I have to do is step off this pedestal. To walk. And believe. </p>
<p>I must believe that I too can warp space to my will, and conjure a path of fog. Because if I don’t believe, then I’ll fall. If I don’t believe, then I’ll be lost to that unforgiving diamond-littered emptiness. </p>
<p>Before she left, Chara rested her hands on my shoulder. “A Cloudstrider’s first steps are always alone. That is the way of our people.”</p>
<p>I stare at the infinite shifting multitudes. The sky surrounds me, crushed velvet to catch my fall.</p>
<p>I close my eyes and lift my arms. I remember the fog beneath my feet, a series of stepping stones landing just where my feet do, a pathway to some unexplored world. </p>
<p>A strand of hair brushes my cheek as I take a step, my cloak whispers against my ankles. The dust beneath my feet is as insubstantial as baby’s breath. Supporting me. Grounding me among the infinite.</p>
<p>Another step. And another. I skip from airy stone to stepping stone, my heart singing as I climb. </p>
<p>The pedestal is but a speck of dust, the star before me bright, beckoning. What worlds does it warm? What people does it hide? I run, and laugh, and take a leap, knowing that if I believe, I will be there in a heartbeat.</p>
<p>I spin and slip away. Stars rush by until I squeeze my eyes shut.</p>
<p>I’m on the ground, enveloped in the smell of decaying leaves. Birds sing. When I open my eyes, all I see is green. I don’t remember anything.</p>
<p>I run.</p>
<p><em>“A Cloudstrider is born only when a planet dies. You, child, were born to Estela when her planet was dying. Save the planet, and the child died. Save the planet, and you cease to exist.”</em></p>
<p><em>“I didn’t ask to live.”</em></p>
<p><em>“But you are alive.”</em></p>
<p><em>Her fingertips brushed my eyelids, as fleeting as the sea breeze. Golden tears caught the moonlight as her hand fell.</em></p>
<p><em>“Don’t cry, little fawnling.”</em></p>
<p><em>I squeezed her hand. “I’m sorry.”</em></p>
<p><em>“It’s alright. I saved the child. And you, my child, you came back to me in the end.”</em></p>
<p><em>Her eyes fluttered shut. The fractures in her skin grew, and gold flaked away from her, catching the night’s breeze. A moment later, she was gone. I closed my eyes, listening, but all I could hear were the waves.</em> </p>
