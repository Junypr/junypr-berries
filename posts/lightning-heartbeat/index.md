I count the space between the   
flash and the   
boom by    
heartbeats.  

one.   
electric-charged late night texts,    
frantic breathing as we listened to the    
rain past the window   
curled up in bed, I wrote a letter:   
love is a house we build with the one loved ---   
I didn't know. did I mean it?    
said I love you because you did   

two. you painted rose-gold visions of marriage, but    
wouldn't hold my hand   
threw me out of the car into the     
pouring rain without a goodbye    
then came begging on your knees for forgiveness, told me    
I love you    
over and over 'til the words tangled into intractable knots    
because you were just the boy    
who ran from the storm to spare his plastic armor from rust, and you   
sacrificed me to the goddess of blind hope

three. endless summer nights pining    
writing before the sun caught up to my darkest secrets   
dancing in the soaking rain 'til I shook in the shock    
of the hazy scent after the storm   
love blurred with lust   
'til I couldn't draw the lines straight   
under starless skies I traded the king for a pawn   

four. when you denied your wooden words   
I realized I had forgotten how to speak.    
for you, I tamed your insecurities, but you    
dismissed my fears, painted over   
my dreams with your prophecies, told me    
my problems were imaginary, said    
I was loved as I was lost, bound    
my wings to a cage that I told myself    
felt like home

five. thought I'd miss you in my month away   
but I couldn't    
bring myself to yearn for you when I    
found freedom in   
solitary sunsets, in   
stranger-filled subway rides, in   
hands warmer than yours, in   
rain pouring down the gorge   
through whitewashed towns you couldn't name   
nor remember    
washing away the dust, for once giving me   
clean air to breathe   

six. lightening strike  
 
maybe it's just my mind  
regressing 
memory under reconstruction  
of once-perfect moments   
staring into your eyes under your sheets   
by the creek, hands on my skin   
now I wince at the cold   
your hearth scorches   
your shelter from the storm  
became a prison   
you forgot to wear gloves when you caught this falcon   
her claws draw blood   
her heart yearns for the skies   

So forgive me if I no longer respond   
if I can't tell you that I love you   
I've shredded the love letters   
burned the past   
swept the ashes into the street   
let the the rain wash it away    
the water set me free
