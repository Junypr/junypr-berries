                <p>I count the space between the <br>
flash and the <br>
boom by  <br>
heartbeats.  </p>
<p>one. <br>
electric-charged late night texts,  <br>
frantic breathing as we listened to the  <br>
rain past the window <br>
curled up in bed, I wrote a letter: <br>
love is a house we build with the one loved --- <br>
I didn't know. did I mean it?  <br>
said I love you because you did   </p>
<p>two. you painted rose-gold visions of marriage, but  <br>
wouldn't hold my hand <br>
threw me out of the car into the   <br>
pouring rain without a goodbye  <br>
then came begging on your knees for forgiveness, told me  <br>
I love you  <br>
over and over 'til the words tangled into intractable knots  <br>
because you were just the boy  <br>
who ran from the storm to spare his plastic armor from rust, and you <br>
sacrificed me to the goddess of blind hope   </p>
<!-- TEASER_END -->

<p>three. endless summer nights pining  <br>
writing before the sun caught up to my darkest secrets <br>
dancing in the soaking rain 'til I shook in the shock  <br>
of the hazy scent after the storm <br>
love blurred with lust <br>
'til I couldn't draw the lines straight <br>
under starless skies I traded the king for a pawn   </p>
<p>four. when you denied your wooden words <br>
I realized I had forgotten how to speak.  <br>
for you, I tamed your insecurities, but you  <br>
dismissed my fears, painted over <br>
my dreams with your prophecies, told me  <br>
my problems were imaginary, said  <br>
I was loved as I was lost, bound  <br>
my wings to a cage that I told myself  <br>
felt like home</p>
<p>five. thought I'd miss you in my month away <br>
but I couldn't  <br>
bring myself to yearn for you when I  <br>
found freedom in <br>
solitary sunsets, in <br>
stranger-filled subway rides, in <br>
hands warmer than yours, in <br>
rain pouring down the gorge <br>
through whitewashed towns you couldn't name <br>
nor remember  <br>
washing away the dust, for once giving me <br>
clean air to breathe   </p>
<p>six. lightening strike  </p>
<p>maybe it's just my mind<br>
regressing 
memory under reconstruction<br>
of once-perfect moments <br>
staring into your eyes under your sheets <br>
by the creek, hands on my skin <br>
now I wince at the cold <br>
your hearth scorches <br>
your shelter from the storm<br>
became a prison <br>
you forgot to wear gloves when you caught this falcon <br>
her claws draw blood <br>
her heart yearns for the skies   </p>
<p>So forgive me if I no longer respond <br>
if I can't tell you that I love you <br>
I've shredded the love letters <br>
burned the past <br>
swept the ashes into the street <br>
let the the rain wash it away  <br>
the water set me free   </p>
