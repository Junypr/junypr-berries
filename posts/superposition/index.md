Despite the months I still can trace your paths   
within my mind like feet once walked each week,   
and gravel crunching underfoot still brings   
the scent of rain-soaked dirt, and tulips raised   
in earthen pots like drops of sunlit blood,   
and chains of purple blooms to tempt the bees   
with springs soft baby's breath. With eyes half closed   
the emerald moss that glimmers in stone cracks   
bejewels my maple's slender arms, and sun   
reflected off the river conjures hoards   
of honking geese alighting on the glass   
lagoons for meager scraps of bread. Thus fog   
unrolled among the concrete crowns   
and pillars might unfurl slow over peaks   
all blanketed with black green pines, and the   
first chills of fall are home's dead winter's cold.   
The east is cloaked in a Pacific haze,   
and I relive with every breath and step    
and sight the sounds and smells of long-loved home.
