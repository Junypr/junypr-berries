so simple, in youth   
my life poured into jars  
I would be a physicist,  
then a journalist,  
then an engineer,  
dreaming of planes  
so sure in that jam jar,  
the world, seen dimly   
through the glass.   

so easy, to wrap  
my story in a bow  
novelist --- tinkerer --- mentor  
but was there space in the epics   
for poetry? the beret  
I never thought I'd don   
were there moments to stare   
at the sky  
connecting the dots of Orion   
night after night?  

my life is odds and ends   
crammed into the jam jar   
of time, I am the   
messenger bag against  
his back, the  
camera bag at my hip, the  
wire frames encircling his eyes, the  
staff I spin, the  
beaver on her lanyard, the  
flourish of my marker, the  
flecks of solder on the floor, the  
things I build and the things I destroy  
the worlds I make and unmake in my mind  
I do not fit so neatly into boxes.
