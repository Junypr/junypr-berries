When I came here I though I'd
fall in love again --- I mean
read the blogs, hear the babies, hold the healed hearts
and you'd think it'd be the same --- but
I didn't think I'd fall in love with this sense of place
Some home we have
Killian in the afternoon on this statue
of frozen granite speckled by 
the last rays of this summer's sun who we'll
bid adieu in a few short hours
unprepared for the drudge through icy darkness, and
infinite corridors and labyrinthine tunnels and
maybe it's silly to be in love with a space
that belongs to so many before and after, but
sometimes I walk
and smile
as if gold's been poured into my heart and
perhaps there's no reason for this but
that's love isn't it?
we never know why we do.
and I think I can close my eyes at night
and listen to the harmony of the spheres
out there in that velvety infinite
and inside my chest
everything feels right
