It's easy to admit.  
The words escape before I register their heartlessness.  
They taste of copper pennies and thin blood  
like your promises of eternity.  
I've freed myself from the shackles of "and,"  
"mine" and "yours" no longer;  
I exist in singularity,  
the period on the last page,  
unpaired, but not lonely,  
satisfied, with the story,  
eager, for the space beyond the back cover.  
It's what I needed ---  
the starless sky of twilight  
to fly as I will  
and space to fall.  
This I find only alone;  
I don't  
miss you.
