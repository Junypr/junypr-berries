Had dinner with you for the first time in years   
and now I see you every week    
perhaps with a banana in hand   
perhaps rushing to class   
and your hair's shorter now   
colors I couldn't imagine   
but you give me the same smile   
that always makes me smile back

I know the feeling of your chest against my back  
warmth seeping from body to body   
the night you crashed in my room   
a brief stop on your way home     
when we exposed our hearts in the way    
we only could with each other   

Perhaps you're going through what I was a year ago   
and perhaps the photos I send cannot convince you that you will,   
in fact, make it through   
but seeing your silhouette emerge from the fog on the bridge    
sharing the view on the terrace   
makes me hope that you, too, will   
find hope in a place  

You eat yogurt with cantaloupe   
ask us how we're doing   
like you did so many mornings back in New Mexico   
the heat and blazing sun's gone, but    
How could I forget your voice, homecoming queen?   

In the morning you twist on the mattress at the base of my bed   
and in an instant I'm taken back to my old room   
we stare at the stars and wonder simply how   
something that lasted only 39 days    
could be something we miss so dearly.   

Now my room feels a little colder, alone   
your presence lingers here, in my heart    
I'll see you again   
so much closer   
until next time, my friend
