I crave touch   
yet recoil from it like a finger from the flame   
or a hand from the clammy forehead of the ill   
my gaze lingers   
yet in looking finds reason to be appalled   
and turn away again   
I sleep alone   
yet find comfort in a body in my room   
not in my bed   
the tension strains my being  
I strive for the balance of a string plucked into tune   
yet chords run dissonant down my spine  
rattling mind and heart  
my life's had but two loves  
one false, one fantasy  
and I do not know  
how to steal back my heart   
from their jaws
