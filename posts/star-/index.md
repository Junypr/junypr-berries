star-gazing star-struck    
on that starry night I was the    
shooting star burning in your    
atmosphere of dark nights     
bus rides through deserts    
head on your shoulder fits    
last-puzzle-piece-perfect   
fingers in your hair    
where soft sharp sand sleeps still, I think  

star-spun binary dance   
thumb across my hand  
silent mountain shade   
late nights flickering flashlights   
dodging cockroaches, grasshoppers   
twirl me til we crash   
let me forget that we were   

star-crossed short-lived   
supernova burning   
sweets keyboard clicks card-shuffles   
endless days, momentary weeks   
torn from the star-strewn inky blackness   
until we were thrown back   

star-struck opportune collision   
you picked at rabbit bones   
thought I could lace my fingers through yours   
keep your hand on my waist through    
Madrid mornings Ronda    
sunsets Alhambra sunrises home to the    
pond-side park bench where I watch    
coots feed their young, alone   

so I look to the sky and ask   
do you see the same   
stars we saw in New Mexico?
