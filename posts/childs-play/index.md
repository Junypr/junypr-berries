leaves drift past the concrete facade    
as if mother oak has shrugged off the season's gaudy attire  
they fly  
then disappear beneath rubber tires   
pulverized  
dust and exhaust fumes  
I rake the survivors off the ground with my fingertips  
bone shards of their skeletons in my hair  
I could build a pile big enough to bury a body  
if childhood starts when I jump into the first pile of leaves  
then can it be said that I was ever a child until now?  
if adulthood starts when we first confront death  
then can it be said that I was ever an adult until now?  
spare me mortality, but keep not from me the changing of the seasons  
nature's little death and resurrection   
is just child's play
