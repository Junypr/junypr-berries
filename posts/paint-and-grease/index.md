Accident was the yellow-black taxi stopped   
at your workshop. Heart-stopped —    
it wasn’t my studio. Heartless    
December snow trampled into metal chips   
under your boots. Paint chips    
under my nails. You liked them.   
Maybe you’d like them painted.   
Chance was the storm keeping me with you.    
No excuse. You handed me pliers,    
a wrench. Taught me to weld like maybe I’d mend    
your broken heart. Broken engine part.    
Rose was the flush of your cheeks    
when I brushed you. Breath-caught beauty,   
that in building two men    
can be uncomfortably close. Beauty,   
in being comfortingly close.   
When the storm cleared   
you bloomed like a rose in the painting    
I made of your crimson-navy swirls    
indigo splatters and flecks of white.    
In attic sunlight, gauze curtains drawn,   
you were my masterpiece. I, the mastermind.    
Maybe I loaded the dice. Maybe weighted coins land    
headfirst. Maybe I was sprinting headfirst   
to keep you by my side.   
And if I smelled like machine grease,    
and you did too.    
And if you smelled like acrylic paint,    
and I did too.   
It would only be coincidence.
