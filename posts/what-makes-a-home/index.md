You aren't good at showing it and honestly   
neither am I, so I    
choose to write for the moment when    
you return to a house   
that will be empty for months as soon as I step   
out the door with my luggage kissing this   
barren place one last    
good-riddance because it's really not the    
bone-white walls or the    
endless steps or the    
infinite mirrors   
I'll miss, because these things don't   
make a house home.  

I don't say it anymore, really, but I    
love you and I  
will miss you when I   
fall asleep on top of a plastic-covered mattress  
in a brick-walled building that I    
will eventually learn to call home.  

Please forgive me if I    
forget to write to reassure you that I   
am in fact alive and have taken out   
my contacts for the night. I know you   
ask because you care.
