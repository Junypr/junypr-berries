we're prettier blurred  
the haze hides our imperfections  
til we are bright as stars  
or green lights at the shore  
perhaps that is why you prefer film  
pastels and soft grain  
perhaps that is why I prefer your memory  
to flesh and blood before me  
in my dreams your touch is featherlight  
and warm like the Iberian sun  
that bronzes your skin  
and make the honey of your eyes glow  
but in my dreams  
I never had to leave
