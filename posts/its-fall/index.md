My mother said the changing autumn leaves filled her with melancholy   
perhaps that is why she chose California    
where summer slips into winter in ever dimming shades of green    
like a photo drained of color until nothing is left but grey   
so smoothly that one never stops to realize the moment    
in which what was had is no longer what you have   

But here I hurtle towards the brink of winter   
desperate to hold onto these last moments in the sun     
watching it sink through my open window    
so painfully aware of what I have    
and am soon to lose   
it falls.

So I watch sunlight illuminate patches of a bride's dress   
pinkies reaching, interlocking, a wedding ring    
hands pressed palm to palm, a girl speaks Spanish on the phone    
a blushing leaf flutters like a yellow swallowtail   
the toddler doesn't quite catch it   
it falls.

The breeze swirls the leaves like a painter's brush    
I want to dance a dance of grief     
sun over the Charles glows golden through the clouds    
and warm on the back of my neck    
crabapple nestled in the leaves   
it falls. 

I observe like I did this morning through glass   
when the face I saw while folding laundry smiled back and waved   
and I tried to catch him on the stairs but was too late   
I see you. I know you.  
I am here. I tell myself I belong.   
it's fall.
