The words escape before I register their heartlessness.<br>

unpaired, but not lonely,<br>
satisfied, with the story,<br>
eager, for the space beyond the back cover.<br>

the starless sky of twilight<br>
to fly as I will<br>

<p>so easy, to wrap<br>
my story in a bow<br>
novelist --- tinkerer --- mentor<br>
but was there space in the epics <br>
for poetry? the beret<br>
I never thought I'd don <br>
were there moments to stare <br>
at the sky<br>
connecting the dots of Orion <br>
night after night?  </p>
<p>my life is odds and ends <br>
crammed into the jam jar <br>
of time, I am the <br>
messenger bag against<br>
his back, the<br>
camera bag at my hip, the<br>
wire frames encircling his eyes, the<br>
staff I spin, the<br>
beaver on her lanyard, the<br>
flourish of my marker, the<br>
flecks of solder on the floor, the<br>
things I build and the things I destroy<br>
the worlds I make and unmake in my mind<br>
I do not fit so neatly into boxes.  </p>

pulverized<br>
dust and exhaust fumes<br>
I rake the survivors off the ground with my fingertips<br>
bone shards of their skeletons in my hair<br>
I could build a pile big enough to bury a body<br>
if childhood starts when I jump into the first pile of leaves<br>
then can it be said that I was ever a child until now?<br>
if adulthood starts when we first confront death<br>
then can it be said that I was ever an adult until now?<br>

within my mind like feet once walked each week, <br>
and gravel crunching underfoot still brings <br>
the scent of rain-soaked dirt, and tulips raised <br>
in earthen pots like drops of sunlit blood, <br>
and chains of purple blooms to tempt the bees <br>
with springs soft baby's breath. With eyes half closed <br>
the emerald moss that glimmers in stone cracks <br>
bejewels my maple's slender arms, and sun <br>
reflected off the river conjures hoards <br>
of honking geese alighting on the glass <br>
lagoons for meager scraps of bread. Thus fog <br>
unrolled among the concrete crowns <br>
and pillars might unfurl slow over peaks <br>
all blanketed with black green pines, and the <br>
first chills of fall are home's dead winter's cold. <br>
The east is cloaked in a Pacific haze, <br>
and I relive with every breath and step  <br>
and sight the sounds and smells of long-loved home.   </p>

<p>The first Wednesday of November shouldn't be this hot<br>
but the air boils with the rage of half a country wronged <br>
condensed into this microcosm of democracy <br>
--- if we can call it that anymore --- <br>
because when does the permission we gave  <br>
with millions of penned-in circles <br>
become a mandate for something we never spoke?<br>
words drawn from the air that never passed our lips. </p>

                        <p>Had dinner with you for the first time in years <br>
and now I see you every week  <br>
perhaps with a banana in hand <br>
perhaps rushing to class <br>
and your hair's shorter now <br>
colors I couldn't imagine <br>
but you give me the same smile <br>
that always makes me smile back</p>
<p>I know the feeling of your chest against my back<br>
warmth seeping from body to body <br>
the night you crashed in my room <br>
a brief stop on your way home   <br>
when we exposed our hearts in the way  <br>
we only could with each other   </p>
<p>Perhaps you're going through what I was a year ago <br>
and perhaps the photos I send cannot convince you that you will, <br>
in fact, make it through <br>
but seeing your silhouette emerge from the fog on the bridge  <br>
sharing the view on the terrace <br>
makes me hope that you, too, will <br>
find hope in a place  </p>
<p>You eat yogurt with cantaloupe <br>
ask us how we're doing <br>
like you did so many mornings back in New Mexico <br>
the heat and blazing sun's gone, but  <br>
How could I forget your voice, homecoming queen?   </p>
<p>In the morning you twist on the mattress at the base of my bed <br>
and in an instant I'm taken back to my old room <br>
we stare at the stars and wonder simply how <br>
something that lasted only 39 days  <br>
could be something we miss so dearly.   </p>
<p>Now my room feels a little colder, alone <br>
your presence lingers here, in my heart  <br>
I'll see you again <br>
so much closer <br>
until next time, my friend   </p>

<p>I was five when you left for the first time. Not the two-week business-trip and visiting-family kind of leaving. Not leaving for good, either. You were there one bleak morning, waving goodbye to me through the security lines, steel-gray suitcase and backpack in hand, then gone. House empty. Peaceful.</p>
<p>At first, you and mother call every night. Then every week. Then almost never. The whispers become more like empty screams and I think I hear the phone ring, my mother not picking up, your voice calling for me, me not picking up. I donâ€™t like hearing the screams. I canâ€™t make out the words, but I know what screaming means.</p>
<p>We visited your Shanghai apartment that summer, and I remember the drip of chocolate-dipped ice cream cones, the fan thinly fighting the heat, the plastic covering of the bed that wasnâ€™t my own. I dreamed that blood was pouring from every pore in my skin that night, into the fabric of a foreign-not-foreign country that I can and canâ€™t call my home.</p>
<p><em>I was seven when you made the business arrangement. Half your year here, with us, half your year there, in the country I knew in my blood but had never seen. Part-time father, my brother called it. I didnâ€™t know what part-time meant. Or maybe he didnâ€™t.</em> </p>
<p><em>I draw sketches of you from faded yellow photos, to give when you return. Mother says Iâ€™m quite good. A natural-born artist.</em> </p>

flash and the <br>
boom by  <br>
heartbeats.  </p>
<p>one. <br>
electric-charged late night texts,  <br>
frantic breathing as we listened to the  <br>
rain past the window <br>
curled up in bed, I wrote a letter: <br>
love is a house we build with the one loved --- <br>
I didn't know. did I mean it?  <br>
said I love you because you did   </p>
<p>two. you painted rose-gold visions of marriage, but  <br>
wouldn't hold my hand <br>
threw me out of the car into the   <br>
pouring rain without a goodbye  <br>
then came begging on your knees for forgiveness, told me  <br>
I love you  <br>
over and over 'til the words tangled into intractable knots  <br>
because you were just the boy  <br>
who ran from the storm to spare his plastic armor from rust, and you <br>
sacrificed me to the goddess of blind hope   </p>

                        <p>Each sunset is a fragile fraction of suspended time, a fresh palette filled with daubs of inimitable paint swirls. 
So I grab my camera and fly down the stairs, 
I don't stop to say hello because something inside my chest tells me that this is what matters, 
that I need to be here, 
breath catching in the crisp fall air as I watch the last glimmers of sunlight fade over the Charles 
and burnish the glass skyscrapers of Boston's skyline gold. 
Something within me finds peace as my eyes ascend the gradient of soft pink blushes and orange streaks into the wash of 
cyan above. Something tells me that I must hold onto this the way I cling to the rail's flaking paint. 
Something tells me this beauty will never be repeated.
Whether this moment brings me joy or brings me to my knees, 
whether the shimmer is fool's gold or true, 
I have only this moment. 
Like sunsets, nothing lasts forever. 
What is there to be done but to enjoy it?</p>
