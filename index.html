on that starry night I was the  <br>
shooting star burning in your  <br>
atmosphere of dark nights   <br>
bus rides through deserts  <br>
head on your shoulder fits  <br>
last-puzzle-piece-perfect <br>
fingers in your hair  <br>
where soft sharp sand sleeps still, I think  </p>

thumb across my hand<br>
silent mountain shade <br>
late nights flickering flashlights <br>
dodging cockroaches, grasshoppers <br>
twirl me til we crash <br>
let me forget that we were   </p>
<p>star-crossed short-lived <br>
supernova burning <br>
sweets keyboard clicks card-shuffles <br>
endless days, momentary weeks <br>
torn from the star-strewn inky blackness <br>
until we were thrown back   </p>
<p>star-struck opportune collision <br>
you picked at rabbit bones <br>
thought I could lace my fingers through yours <br>
keep your hand on my waist through  <br>
Madrid mornings Ronda  <br>
sunsets Alhambra sunrises home to the  <br>
pond-side park bench where I watch  <br>
coots feed their young, alone   </p>
<p>so I look to the sky and ask <br>
do you see the same <br>
stars we saw in New Mexico?</p>

<p><em>It started with a dying woman.</em></p>
<p><em>She stared from the hemp hammock with silver eyes matching mine. Except there wasn’t a star burning within, just the leaden shine of the three moons through the hut’s reed roof. She resembled me, it was true. The same abyssal hair flecked with stars, the same galaxial swirls dancing across her skin. Even the same flowing robes licked with violet flames, woven from the gasps of a dying star.</em></p>
<p><em>The villager with the sun-washed chest and shell-bead necklace smiled. “She told us to expect you.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Expect me?”</em></p>
<p>It started with darkness.</p>
<p>It’s dark in the space between the stars. It’s dark, and it’s cold, and it’s empty, and it’s where I go to clear my head. I float, where time and space freeze, watching the planets hum their endless melodies, watching newborn stars gasp their first breaths or dying ones scream their last. When I tire of the infinite lights, I close my eyes.</p>
<p>My name is Eva Cloudstrider, I mold the fabric of space and time, and I don’t know why I’m here. Maybe if I listen long enough, I’ll find out.</p>
<p>All I hear is a scream. A scream that winds around me until I’m caught in its embrace. A scream that tugs, ever stronger, until I take a step and time spins and spools and falls away. </p>
<p>I’m on a beach. The sand like stars again skin darker than the end of time, the waves a kiss upon milky cheeks. </p>
<p>The scream is louder.</p>
<p>The scream is death.</p>

                        <p>You aren't good at showing it and honestly <br>
neither am I, so I  <br>
choose to write for the moment when  <br>
you return to a house <br>
that will be empty for months as soon as I step <br>
out the door with my luggage kissing this <br>
barren place one last  <br>
good-riddance because it's really not the  <br>
bone-white walls or the  <br>
endless steps or the  <br>
infinite mirrors <br>
I'll miss, because these things don't <br>
make a house home.  </p>
<p>I don't say it anymore, really, but I  <br>
love you and I<br>
will miss you when I <br>
fall asleep on top of a plastic-covered mattress<br>
in a brick-walled building that I  <br>
will eventually learn to call home.  </p>
<p>Please forgive me if I  <br>
forget to write to reassure you that I <br>
am in fact alive and have taken out <br>
my contacts for the night. I know you <br>
ask because you care.   </p>

                        <p>Accident was the yellow-black taxi stopped <br>
at your workshop. Heart-stopped —  <br>
it wasn’t my studio. Heartless  <br>
December snow trampled into metal chips <br>
under your boots. Paint chips  <br>
under my nails. You liked them. <br>
Maybe you’d like them painted. <br>
Chance was the storm keeping me with you.  <br>
No excuse. You handed me pliers,  <br>
a wrench. Taught me to weld like maybe I’d mend  <br>
your broken heart. Broken engine part.  <br>
Rose was the flush of your cheeks  <br>
when I brushed you. Breath-caught beauty, <br>
that in building two men  <br>
can be uncomfortably close. Beauty, <br>
in being comfortingly close. <br>
When the storm cleared <br>
you bloomed like a rose in the painting  <br>
I made of your crimson-navy swirls  <br>
indigo splatters and flecks of white.  <br>
In attic sunlight, gauze curtains drawn, <br>
you were my masterpiece. I, the mastermind.  <br>
Maybe I loaded the dice. Maybe weighted coins land  <br>
headfirst. Maybe I was sprinting headfirst <br>
to keep you by my side. <br>
And if I smelled like machine grease,  <br>
and you did too.  <br>
And if you smelled like acrylic paint,  <br>
and I did too. <br>
It would only be coincidence.    </p>

                        <p>one. couple in worn-out jeans who'd drive a Jeep with the doors 
torn off and paint their walls lime green to piss off the neighbors. 
the man upends a bag of sandwich crumbs, shoos the ducks back their 
side of the fence with steel-toed boot stomps. simple equation: good 
fences equal good neighbors. the ducks slide underneath. </p>
<p>two. mother who mistook you for a proper chinese child who learned 
their mother tongue in the crib like hers, now in college. hao ya zi. 
awkward american accent: yeah. </p>
<p>three. not-man-not-woman-not-neither-maybe-all-of-the-above. cropped 
blonde hair makes them look like your colead. olive bomber jacket, lanky 
legs, might be your classmate. someone from your past. who you want to 
be in the future. they run like they're being tailed. maybe by you.</p>
<p>four. young couple, not holding hands, but she bumps against him, the cuff 
of her sleek leather jacket touching his jeans. he is forgettable beyond 
belief, your eyes slide to the ducks crossing the sidewalk. her black hair 
is pulled into a stubby ponytail, she looks like the photos of you. you 
follow. you never see her face, but you don't want to, you think. in case 
she looks like you.</p>

                        <p>My mother said the changing autumn leaves filled her with melancholy <br>
perhaps that is why she chose California  <br>
where summer slips into winter in ever dimming shades of green  <br>
like a photo drained of color until nothing is left but grey <br>
so smoothly that one never stops to realize the moment  <br>
in which what was had is no longer what you have   </p>
<p>But here I hurtle towards the brink of winter <br>
desperate to hold onto these last moments in the sun   <br>
watching it sink through my open window  <br>
so painfully aware of what I have  <br>
and am soon to lose <br>
it falls.</p>
<p>So I watch sunlight illuminate patches of a bride's dress <br>
pinkies reaching, interlocking, a wedding ring  <br>
hands pressed palm to palm, a girl speaks Spanish on the phone  <br>
a blushing leaf flutters like a yellow swallowtail <br>
the toddler doesn't quite catch it <br>
it falls.</p>
<p>The breeze swirls the leaves like a painter's brush  <br>
I want to dance a dance of grief   <br>
sun over the Charles glows golden through the clouds  <br>
and warm on the back of my neck  <br>
crabapple nestled in the leaves <br>
it falls. </p>
<p>I observe like I did this morning through glass <br>
when the face I saw while folding laundry smiled back and waved <br>
and I tried to catch him on the stairs but was too late <br>
I see you. I know you.<br>
I am here. I tell myself I belong. <br>
it's fall. </p>

                        <p>When I came here I thought I'd <br>
fall in love again --- I mean <br>
read the blogs, hear the babies, hold the healed hearts <br>
and you'd think it'd be the same --- but<br>
I didn't think I'd fall in love with this sense of place<br>
Some home we have <br>
Killian in the afternoon on this statue <br>
of frozen granite speckled by  <br>
the last rays of this summer's sun who we'll  <br>
bid adieu in a few short hours <br>
unprepared for the drudge through icy darkness, and <br>
infinite corridors and labyrinthine tunnels and <br>
maybe it's silly to be in love with a space <br>
that belongs to so many before and after, but <br>
sometimes I walk <br>
and smile <br>
as if gold's been poured into my heart and<br>
perhaps there's no reason for this but<br>
that's love isn't it?<br>
we never know why we do.<br>
and I think I can close my eyes at night<br>
and listen to the harmony of the spheres<br>
out there in that velvety infinite <br>
and inside my chest  <br>
everything feels right   </p>
