                        <p>Had dinner with you for the first time in years <br>
and now I see you every week  <br>
perhaps with a banana in hand <br>
perhaps rushing to class <br>
and your hair's shorter now <br>
colors I couldn't imagine <br>
but you give me the same smile <br>
that always makes me smile back</p>
<p>I know the feeling of your chest against my back<br>
warmth seeping from body to body <br>
the night you crashed in my room <br>
a brief stop on your way home   <br>
when we exposed our hearts in the way  <br>
we only could with each other   </p>
<p>Perhaps you're going through what I was a year ago <br>
and perhaps the photos I send cannot convince you that you will, <br>
in fact, make it through <br>
but seeing your silhouette emerge from the fog on the bridge  <br>
sharing the view on the terrace <br>
makes me hope that you, too, will <br>
find hope in a place  </p>
<p>You eat yogurt with cantaloupe <br>
ask us how we're doing <br>
like you did so many mornings back in New Mexico <br>
the heat and blazing sun's gone, but  <br>
How could I forget your voice, homecoming queen?   </p>
<p>In the morning you twist on the mattress at the base of my bed <br>
and in an instant I'm taken back to my old room <br>
we stare at the stars and wonder simply how <br>
something that lasted only 39 days  <br>
could be something we miss so dearly.   </p>
<p>Now my room feels a little colder, alone <br>
your presence lingers here, in my heart  <br>
I'll see you again <br>
so much closer <br>
until next time, my friend   </p>

<p>I was five when you left for the first time. Not the two-week business-trip and visiting-family kind of leaving. Not leaving for good, either. You were there one bleak morning, waving goodbye to me through the security lines, steel-gray suitcase and backpack in hand, then gone. House empty. Peaceful.</p>
<p>At first, you and mother call every night. Then every week. Then almost never. The whispers become more like empty screams and I think I hear the phone ring, my mother not picking up, your voice calling for me, me not picking up. I don’t like hearing the screams. I can’t make out the words, but I know what screaming means.</p>
<p>We visited your Shanghai apartment that summer, and I remember the drip of chocolate-dipped ice cream cones, the fan thinly fighting the heat, the plastic covering of the bed that wasn’t my own. I dreamed that blood was pouring from every pore in my skin that night, into the fabric of a foreign-not-foreign country that I can and can’t call my home.</p>
<p><em>I was seven when you made the business arrangement. Half your year here, with us, half your year there, in the country I knew in my blood but had never seen. Part-time father, my brother called it. I didn’t know what part-time meant. Or maybe he didn’t.</em> </p>
<p><em>I draw sketches of you from faded yellow photos, to give when you return. Mother says I’m quite good. A natural-born artist.</em> </p>

flash and the <br>
boom by  <br>
heartbeats.  </p>
<p>one. <br>
electric-charged late night texts,  <br>
frantic breathing as we listened to the  <br>
rain past the window <br>
curled up in bed, I wrote a letter: <br>
love is a house we build with the one loved --- <br>
I didn't know. did I mean it?  <br>
said I love you because you did   </p>
<p>two. you painted rose-gold visions of marriage, but  <br>
wouldn't hold my hand <br>
threw me out of the car into the   <br>
pouring rain without a goodbye  <br>
then came begging on your knees for forgiveness, told me  <br>
I love you  <br>
over and over 'til the words tangled into intractable knots  <br>
because you were just the boy  <br>
who ran from the storm to spare his plastic armor from rust, and you <br>
sacrificed me to the goddess of blind hope   </p>

                        <p>Each sunset is a fragile fraction of a moment suspended in time like a mote of dust in a sunbeam. 
Each day brings a new palette, daubs of inimitable hand-mixed paint swirls. 
So I grab my camera and fly down the stairs, 
I don't stop to say hello because something inside my chest tells me that this is what matters, 
that I need to be here, 
breath catching in the crisp fall air as I watch the last glimmers of sunlight fade over the Charles 
and burnish the glass skyscrapers of Boston's skyline gold. 
Something within me finds peace as my eyes ascend the gradient of soft pink blushes and orange streaks into the wash of 
cyan above. Something tells me that I must hold onto this the way I cling to the rail's flaking paint. 
Something tells me this beauty will never be repeated.
Whether this moment brings me joy or brings me to my knees, 
whether the shimmer is fool's gold or true, 
I have only this moment. 
Like sunsets, nothing lasts forever. 
What is there to be done but to enjoy it?</p>

<p><em>It started with a dying woman.</em></p>
<p><em>She stared from the hemp hammock with silver eyes matching mine. Except there wasn’t a star burning within, just the leaden shine of the three moons through the hut’s reed roof. She resembled me, it was true. The same abyssal hair flecked with stars, the same galaxial swirls dancing across her skin. Even the same flowing robes licked with violet flames, woven from the gasps of a dying star.</em></p>
<p><em>The villager with the sun-washed chest and shell-bead necklace smiled. “She told us to expect you.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Expect me?”</em></p>
<p>It started with darkness.</p>
<p>It’s dark in the space between the stars. It’s dark, and it’s cold, and it’s empty, and it’s where I go to clear my head. I float, where time and space freeze, watching the planets hum their endless melodies, watching newborn stars gasp their first breaths or dying ones scream their last. When I tire of the infinite lights, I close my eyes.</p>
<p>My name is Eva Cloudstrider, I mold the fabric of space and time, and I don’t know why I’m here. Maybe if I listen long enough, I’ll find out.</p>
<p>All I hear is a scream. A scream that winds around me until I’m caught in its embrace. A scream that tugs, ever stronger, until I take a step and time spins and spools and falls away. </p>
<p>I’m on a beach. The sand like stars again skin darker than the end of time, the waves a kiss upon milky cheeks. </p>
<p>The scream is louder.</p>
<p>The scream is death.</p>

                        <p>Accident was the yellow-black taxi stopped <br>
at your workshop. Heart-stopped —  <br>
it wasn’t my studio. Heartless  <br>
December snow trampled into metal chips <br>
under your boots. Paint chips  <br>
under my nails. You liked them. <br>
Maybe you’d like them painted. <br>
Chance was the storm keeping me with you.  <br>
No excuse. You handed me pliers,  <br>
a wrench. Taught me to weld like maybe I’d mend  <br>
your broken heart. Broken engine part.  <br>
Rose was the flush of your cheeks  <br>
when I brushed you. Breath-caught beauty, <br>
that in building two men  <br>
can be uncomfortably close. Beauty, <br>
in being comfortingly close. <br>
When the storm cleared <br>
you bloomed like a rose in the painting  <br>
I made of your crimson-navy swirls  <br>
indigo splatters and flecks of white.  <br>
In attic sunlight, gauze curtains drawn, <br>
you were my masterpiece. I, the mastermind.  <br>
Maybe I loaded the dice. Maybe weighted coins land  <br>
headfirst. Maybe I was sprinting headfirst <br>
to keep you by my side. <br>
And if I smelled like machine grease,  <br>
and you did too.  <br>
And if you smelled like acrylic paint,  <br>
and I did too. <br>
It would only be coincidence.    </p>

desperate to hold onto these last moments in the sun   <br>
watching it sink through my open window  <br>
so painfully aware of what I have  <br>
and am soon to lose <br>
it falls.</p>
<p>So I watch sunlight illuminate patches of a bride's dress <br>
pinkies reaching, interlocking, a wedding ring  <br>
hands pressed palm to palm, a girl speaks Spanish on the phone  <br>
a blushing leaf flutters like a yellow swallowtail <br>
the toddler doesn't quite catch it <br>
it falls.</p>
<p>The breeze swirls the leaves like a painter's brush  <br>
I want to dance a dance of grief   <br>
sun over the Charles glows golden through the clouds  <br>
and warm on the back of my neck  <br>
crabapple nestled in the leaves <br>
it falls. </p>
<p>I observe like I did this morning through glass <br>
when the face I saw while folding laundry smiled back and waved <br>
and I tried to catch him on the stairs but was too late <br>
I see you. I know you.<br>
I am here. I tell myself I belong. <br>
it's fall. </p>
