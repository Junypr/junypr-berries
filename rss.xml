Not the two-week business-trip and visiting-family kind of leaving. Not leaving for good, either. You were there one bleak morning, waving goodbye to me through the security lines, steel-gray suitcase and backpack in hand, then gone. House empty. Peaceful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, you and mother call every night. Then every week. Then almost never. The whispers become more like empty screams and I think I hear the phone ring, my mother not picking up, your voice calling for me, me not picking up. I don’t like hearing the screams. I can’t make out the words, but I know what screaming means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We visited your Shanghai apartment that summer, and I remember the drip of chocolate-dipped ice cream cones, the fan thinly fighting the heat, the plastic covering of the bed that wasn’t my own. I dreamed that blood was pouring from every pore in my skin that night, into the fabric of a foreign-not-foreign country that I can and can’t call my home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I was seven when you made the business arrangement. Half your year here, with us, half your year there, in the country I knew in my blood but had never seen. Part-time father, my brother called it. I didn’t know what part-time meant. Or maybe he didn’t.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I draw sketches of you from faded yellow photos, to give when you return. Mother says I’m quite good. A natural-born artist.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you come back you bring a suitcase full of gifts. Snacks. I like the thin not-mint hawthorne candies and the rolls of fruit leather in little plastic packages with words I cannot read. You give me a pencil sharpener. It could sharpen a finger. I don’t know why it says “a little girl and boy” on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You take me to the department store, and I fidget through hours of escalator rides and check-out lines. You buy a cardboard “A” for me. For the race I am and the grades I am supposed to get — except you forget that I am in kindergarten and do not have those kinds of grades yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When you are home, you wake me up with a steaming mug of coffee in hand, and drive me to school before returning home to work. When you’re not home, my alarm forgets to wake me up on time. I arrive at math late and groggy, sky-blue thermos of instant coffee in hand.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While you’re gone, we find out that my passport needs renewing. You go to the consulate in Shanghai to get an affidavit notarized, except you’ve gotten my name wrong. It’s Emily, not Emma. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mom calls for the first time in weeks, and you make a second trip. I hope you’re properly embarrassed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I learn to play the violin. You don’t like my drawings.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am in middle school and have a poster of a NASA facility on my door, torn out from a magazine. I line my shelves with lego helicopters and 3D prints of robots I clumsily designed. You give me pink unicorn tape and an electric trash can whose lid opens like the jaws of a steel hippo at the push of a button. I can’t figure out how to turn it off and I don’t know why you couldn’t have gotten one with a pedal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You ask me what I want to do, and I say, “physics.” You tell me about your childhood, exaggerating your class ranking. I’ve stopped listening after the third time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You say the haircut I gave myself is ugly and my face needs washing. You ask me when I am going to get a boyfriend. Then you ask when I’m going to get married. I think you forget I’m in middle school. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’m happy when you’re home, but I can’t pretend everything’s alright. You ask my brother how he enjoys tennis and forget that he is still recovering from a broken wrist that happened a few weeks after you left. He doesn’t say anything, but I can sense his retreat. He digs trenches and throws barbed wire around himself.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the mornings, when you’re here, you make yourself a mug of overly-sweetened coffee, until the smell permeates every scrap of wood and I think I’ll never get rid of it. I try to avoid having breakfast with you, but I’m too tired to wake up early and too tired to listen to my mom yell at me for getting up so late. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t like dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My brother goes to college, and suddenly you’re awakened to his academic mediocrity. I guess you never realized that, with your absences, until he’s packing for a mid-level public school and you’ve become the joke of your ex-pat parties.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The pressure’s on me, the only child in the house. Mother tries to shield me, but she can’t stop the barrage. Art is a waste, computer science is the only option. I'm dropped out of the painting class I love. Now it’s not good enough to play the violin. Now I have to be the best in the state. I play until my fingers callus, then bleed, then callus again. I didn’t even know that was possible.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You tell me that I’m not going to waste my life partying and studying statistics like my brother.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s rats in the attic and leaking pipes in the walls but you’ve never bothered to ask how we’re fixing it. The house is your hotel. You walk on carpets with muddy shoes, leave the door open until the hallways are full of dust and flies, and leave us to clean up once you’re gone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dinner conversations are empty. You lecture me on your successes in drugs to fight cancer but never remember the projects I’m working on. You think I should be a doctor. I know better. Look at what you did to my brother and sister.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You insist on salmon or steak every night, as if you’ve been starved in China. I grow tired of the dry flesh and lock myself in my room. I find solace in music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My brother’s pierced his ears, grown his hair long, and is taking a liking to sky-blue bomber jackets over hoodies and dyed hair. He looks different every time he comes back. I like it. You don’t. Mother blames you for it. Lack of a strong male presence and all. I think she wants a divorce.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Except I’m in the house still, and I’m too busy to waste time worrying.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We meet at a summer camp. You have no idea what we’re doing. You pretend you’re proud but we know you’re not. We track vanishingly faint asteroids in the sky and realize that we are not alone. Not in the universe, not in our predicament. We’re free.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s a nice feeling.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We move and I slam doors in this old-new house and when my mother asks me why, all I can say is that you keep me up at night, listening to videos without headphones in your study next door, stomping around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s true. It’s been true for a long time. I can’t really articulate why I hate you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When I return home and that beautiful, blessed freedom is taken away from me, I shut myself in my room and cry for a long time. I’m alone. I’m one single speck of dust dropped into the velvety black infinite.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I keep in touch with my friends from camp. They know how I’m feeling. One contacts my mother, who tries to talk to me. But she can’t stop you. I hear raised voices. You think I can’t understand Chinese, but I do. And you say “divorce” in English anyway.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t know that it’s college application season for me, but you act like you’ve been waiting for it your whole life. Except the only question you ask is if I’m applying to an Ivy League. And the only response I can give is yes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t know what my dream school is, and you don’t know that I got in. And I’m glad to be going a long, long ways away from home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He tells me that his mother’s made it final. She’s keeping the house. He’s been accepted. And he, too, is glad to be going a long, long ways away from home. &lt;/p&gt;</description><category>a collection of experiences from my life and friend's</category><category>prose</category><category>short story</category><guid>https://junypr.github.io/junypr-berries/posts/part-time-father/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 23 Oct 2024 00:09:25 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Lightning Heartbeat</title><link>https://junypr.github.io/junypr-berries/posts/lightning-heartbeat/</link><dc:creator>Alex Ding</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;I count the space between the &lt;br&gt;
flash and the &lt;br&gt;
boom by  &lt;br&gt;
heartbeats.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;one. &lt;br&gt;
electric-charged late night texts,  &lt;br&gt;
frantic breathing as we listened to the  &lt;br&gt;
rain past the window &lt;br&gt;
curled up in bed, I wrote a letter: &lt;br&gt;
love is a house we build with the one loved --- &lt;br&gt;
I didn't know. did I mean it?  &lt;br&gt;
said I love you because you did   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;two. you painted rose-gold visions of marriage, but  &lt;br&gt;
wouldn't hold my hand &lt;br&gt;
threw me out of the car into the   &lt;br&gt;
pouring rain without a goodbye  &lt;br&gt;
then came begging on your knees for forgiveness, told me  &lt;br&gt;
I love you  &lt;br&gt;
over and over 'til the words tangled into intractable knots  &lt;br&gt;
because you were just the boy  &lt;br&gt;
who ran from the storm to spare his plastic armor from rust, and you &lt;br&gt;
sacrificed me to the goddess of blind hope   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;three. endless summer nights pining  &lt;br&gt;
writing before the sun caught up to my darkest secrets &lt;br&gt;
dancing in the soaking rain 'til I shook in the shock  &lt;br&gt;
of the hazy scent after the storm &lt;br&gt;
love blurred with lust &lt;br&gt;
'til I couldn't draw the lines straight &lt;br&gt;
under starless skies I traded the king for a pawn   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;four. when you denied your wooden words &lt;br&gt;
I realized I had forgotten how to speak.  &lt;br&gt;
for you, I tamed your insecurities, but you  &lt;br&gt;
dismissed my fears, painted over &lt;br&gt;
my dreams with your prophecies, told me  &lt;br&gt;
my problems were imaginary, said  &lt;br&gt;
I was loved as I was lost, bound  &lt;br&gt;
my wings to a cage that I told myself  &lt;br&gt;
felt like home&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;five. thought I'd miss you in my month away &lt;br&gt;
but I couldn't  &lt;br&gt;
bring myself to yearn for you when I  &lt;br&gt;
found freedom in &lt;br&gt;
solitary sunsets, in &lt;br&gt;
stranger-filled subway rides, in &lt;br&gt;
hands warmer than yours, in &lt;br&gt;
rain pouring down the gorge &lt;br&gt;
through whitewashed towns you couldn't name &lt;br&gt;
nor remember  &lt;br&gt;
washing away the dust, for once giving me &lt;br&gt;
clean air to breathe   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;six. lightening strike  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;maybe it's just my mind&lt;br&gt;
regressing 
memory under reconstruction&lt;br&gt;
of once-perfect moments &lt;br&gt;
staring into your eyes under your sheets &lt;br&gt;
by the creek, hands on my skin &lt;br&gt;
now I wince at the cold &lt;br&gt;
your hearth scorches &lt;br&gt;
your shelter from the storm&lt;br&gt;
became a prison &lt;br&gt;
you forgot to wear gloves when you caught this falcon &lt;br&gt;
her claws draw blood &lt;br&gt;
her heart yearns for the skies   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So forgive me if I no longer respond &lt;br&gt;
if I can't tell you that I love you &lt;br&gt;
I've shredded the love letters &lt;br&gt;
burned the past &lt;br&gt;
swept the ashes into the street &lt;br&gt;
let the the rain wash it away  &lt;br&gt;
the water set me free   &lt;/p&gt;</description><category>leaving</category><category>love</category><category>poetry</category><guid>https://junypr.github.io/junypr-berries/posts/lightning-heartbeat/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 23 Oct 2024 00:03:43 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The Thing About Sunsets</title><link>https://junypr.github.io/junypr-berries/posts/the-thing-about-sunsets/</link><dc:creator>Alex Ding</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;Each sunset is a fragile fraction of a moment suspended in time like a mote of dust in a sunbeam. 
Each day brings a new palette, daubs of inimitable hand-mixed paint swirls. 
So I grab my camera and fly down the stairs, 
I don't stop to say hello because something inside my chest tells me that this is what matters, 
that I need to be here, 
breath catching in the crisp fall air as I watch the last glimmers of sunlight fade over the Charles 
and burnish the glass skyscrapers of Boston's skyline gold. 
Something within me finds peace as my eyes ascend the gradient of soft pink blushes and orange streaks into the wash of 
cyan above. Something tells me that I must hold onto this the way I cling to the rail's flaking paint. 
Something tells me this beauty will never be repeated.
Whether this moment brings me joy or brings me to my knees, 
whether the shimmer is fool's gold or true, 
I have only this moment. 
Like sunsets, nothing lasts forever. 
What is there to be done but to enjoy it?&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>prose</category><category>random thoughts</category><category>sunsets</category><guid>https://junypr.github.io/junypr-berries/posts/the-thing-about-sunsets/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 22 Oct 2024 23:56:30 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Star-</title><link>https://junypr.github.io/junypr-berries/posts/star-/</link><dc:creator>Alex Ding</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;star-gazing star-struck  &lt;br&gt;
on that starry night I was the  &lt;br&gt;
shooting star burning in your  &lt;br&gt;
atmosphere of dark nights   &lt;br&gt;
bus rides through deserts  &lt;br&gt;
head on your shoulder fits  &lt;br&gt;
last-puzzle-piece-perfect &lt;br&gt;
fingers in your hair  &lt;br&gt;
where soft sharp sand sleeps still, I think  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;star-spun binary dance &lt;br&gt;
thumb across my hand&lt;br&gt;
silent mountain shade &lt;br&gt;
late nights flickering flashlights &lt;br&gt;
dodging cockroaches, grasshoppers &lt;br&gt;
twirl me til we crash &lt;br&gt;
let me forget that we were   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;star-crossed short-lived &lt;br&gt;
supernova burning &lt;br&gt;
sweets keyboard clicks card-shuffles &lt;br&gt;
endless days, momentary weeks &lt;br&gt;
torn from the star-strewn inky blackness &lt;br&gt;
until we were thrown back   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;star-struck opportune collision &lt;br&gt;
you picked at rabbit bones &lt;br&gt;
thought I could lace my fingers through yours &lt;br&gt;
keep your hand on my waist through  &lt;br&gt;
Madrid mornings Ronda  &lt;br&gt;
sunsets Alhambra sunrises home to the  &lt;br&gt;
pond-side park bench where I watch  &lt;br&gt;
coots feed their young, alone   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so I look to the sky and ask &lt;br&gt;
do you see the same &lt;br&gt;
stars we saw in New Mexico?&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>astronomy</category><category>love</category><category>things I write because I need to</category><guid>https://junypr.github.io/junypr-berries/posts/star-/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 06 Oct 2024 02:02:32 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Cloudstrider</title><link>https://junypr.github.io/junypr-berries/posts/cloudstrider/</link><dc:creator>Alex Ding</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It started with a dying woman.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;She stared from the hemp hammock with silver eyes matching mine. Except there wasn’t a star burning within, just the leaden shine of the three moons through the hut’s reed roof. She resembled me, it was true. The same abyssal hair flecked with stars, the same galaxial swirls dancing across her skin. Even the same flowing robes licked with violet flames, woven from the gasps of a dying star.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The villager with the sun-washed chest and shell-bead necklace smiled. “She told us to expect you.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Expect me?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It started with darkness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s dark in the space between the stars. It’s dark, and it’s cold, and it’s empty, and it’s where I go to clear my head. I float, where time and space freeze, watching the planets hum their endless melodies, watching newborn stars gasp their first breaths or dying ones scream their last. When I tire of the infinite lights, I close my eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My name is Eva Cloudstrider, I mold the fabric of space and time, and I don’t know why I’m here. Maybe if I listen long enough, I’ll find out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All I hear is a scream. A scream that winds around me until I’m caught in its embrace. A scream that tugs, ever stronger, until I take a step and time spins and spools and falls away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m on a beach. The sand like stars again skin darker than the end of time, the waves a kiss upon milky cheeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scream is louder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scream is death.&lt;/p&gt;

neither am I, so I  &lt;br&gt;
choose to write for the moment when  &lt;br&gt;
you return to a house &lt;br&gt;
that will be empty for months as soon as I step &lt;br&gt;
out the door with my luggage kissing this &lt;br&gt;
barren place one last  &lt;br&gt;
good-riddance because it's really not the  &lt;br&gt;
bone-white walls or the  &lt;br&gt;
endless steps or the  &lt;br&gt;
infinite mirrors &lt;br&gt;
I'll miss, because these things don't &lt;br&gt;
make a house home.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't say it anymore, really, but I  &lt;br&gt;
love you and I&lt;br&gt;
will miss you when I &lt;br&gt;
fall asleep on top of a plastic-covered mattress&lt;br&gt;
in a brick-walled building that I  &lt;br&gt;
will eventually learn to call home.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please forgive me if I  &lt;br&gt;
forget to write to reassure you that I &lt;br&gt;
am in fact alive and have taken out &lt;br&gt;
my contacts for the night. I know you &lt;br&gt;
ask because you care.   &lt;/p&gt;</description><category>home</category><category>letters I never sent and never will</category><category>topographical poetry</category><guid>https://junypr.github.io/junypr-berries/posts/what-makes-a-home/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 05 Oct 2024 19:54:21 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Paint and Grease</title><link>https://junypr.github.io/junypr-berries/posts/paint-and-grease/</link><dc:creator>Alex Ding</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;Accident was the yellow-black taxi stopped &lt;br&gt;
at your workshop. Heart-stopped —  &lt;br&gt;
it wasn’t my studio. Heartless  &lt;br&gt;
December snow trampled into metal chips &lt;br&gt;
under your boots. Paint chips  &lt;br&gt;
under my nails. You liked them. &lt;br&gt;
Maybe you’d like them painted. &lt;br&gt;
Chance was the storm keeping me with you.  &lt;br&gt;
No excuse. You handed me pliers,  &lt;br&gt;
a wrench. Taught me to weld like maybe I’d mend  &lt;br&gt;
your broken heart. Broken engine part.  &lt;br&gt;
Rose was the flush of your cheeks  &lt;br&gt;
when I brushed you. Breath-caught beauty, &lt;br&gt;
that in building two men  &lt;br&gt;
can be uncomfortably close. Beauty, &lt;br&gt;
in being comfortingly close. &lt;br&gt;
When the storm cleared &lt;br&gt;
you bloomed like a rose in the painting  &lt;br&gt;
I made of your crimson-navy swirls  &lt;br&gt;
indigo splatters and flecks of white.  &lt;br&gt;
In attic sunlight, gauze curtains drawn, &lt;br&gt;
you were my masterpiece. I, the mastermind.  &lt;br&gt;
Maybe I loaded the dice. Maybe weighted coins land  &lt;br&gt;
headfirst. Maybe I was sprinting headfirst &lt;br&gt;
to keep you by my side. &lt;br&gt;
And if I smelled like machine grease,  &lt;br&gt;
and you did too.  &lt;br&gt;
And if you smelled like acrylic paint,  &lt;br&gt;
and I did too. &lt;br&gt;
It would only be coincidence.    &lt;/p&gt;</description><category>art</category><category>love</category><category>machines</category><category>not autobiographical</category><category>things I write because I can</category><guid>https://junypr.github.io/junypr-berries/posts/paint-and-grease/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 05 Oct 2024 19:52:21 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The four people you meet by the pond</title><link>https://junypr.github.io/junypr-berries/posts/the-four-people-you-meet-by-the-pond/</link><dc:creator>Alex Ding</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;one. couple in worn-out jeans who'd drive a Jeep with the doors

the man upends a bag of sandwich crumbs, shoos the ducks back their 
side of the fence with steel-toed boot stomps. simple equation: good 
fences equal good neighbors. the ducks slide underneath. &lt;/p&gt;

of her sleek leather jacket touching his jeans. he is forgettable beyond 
belief, your eyes slide to the ducks crossing the sidewalk. her black hair

perhaps that is why she chose California  &lt;br&gt;
where summer slips into winter in ever dimming shades of green  &lt;br&gt;
like a photo drained of color until nothing is left but grey &lt;br&gt;
so smoothly that one never stops to realize the moment  &lt;br&gt;
in which what was had is no longer what you have   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here I hurtle towards the brink of winter &lt;br&gt;
desperate to hold onto these last moments in the sun   &lt;br&gt;
watching it sink through my open window  &lt;br&gt;
so painfully aware of what I have  &lt;br&gt;
and am soon to lose &lt;br&gt;
it falls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I watch sunlight illuminate patches of a bride's dress &lt;br&gt;
pinkies reaching, interlocking, a wedding ring  &lt;br&gt;
hands pressed palm to palm, a girl speaks Spanish on the phone  &lt;br&gt;
a blushing leaf flutters like a yellow swallowtail &lt;br&gt;
the toddler doesn't quite catch it &lt;br&gt;
it falls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The breeze swirls the leaves like a painter's brush  &lt;br&gt;
I want to dance a dance of grief   &lt;br&gt;
sun over the Charles glows golden through the clouds  &lt;br&gt;
and warm on the back of my neck  &lt;br&gt;
crabapple nestled in the leaves &lt;br&gt;
it falls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I observe like I did this morning through glass &lt;br&gt;
when the face I saw while folding laundry smiled back and waved &lt;br&gt;
and I tried to catch him on the stairs but was too late &lt;br&gt;
I see you. I know you.&lt;br&gt;
I am here. I tell myself I belong. &lt;br&gt;
it's fall. &lt;/p&gt;</description><category>autumn</category><category>just waiting for the seasonal affective disorder to set in</category><category>topographical poetry</category><guid>https://junypr.github.io/junypr-berries/posts/its-fall/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 05 Oct 2024 19:44:07 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>An Ode to Here</title><link>https://junypr.github.io/junypr-berries/posts/an-ode-to-here/</link><dc:creator>Alex Ding</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;When I came here I thought I'd &lt;br&gt;
fall in love again --- I mean &lt;br&gt;
read the blogs, hear the babies, hold the healed hearts &lt;br&gt;
and you'd think it'd be the same --- but&lt;br&gt;
I didn't think I'd fall in love with this sense of place&lt;br&gt;
Some home we have &lt;br&gt;
Killian in the afternoon on this statue &lt;br&gt;
of frozen granite speckled by  &lt;br&gt;
the last rays of this summer's sun who we'll  &lt;br&gt;
bid adieu in a few short hours &lt;br&gt;
unprepared for the drudge through icy darkness, and &lt;br&gt;
infinite corridors and labyrinthine tunnels and &lt;br&gt;
maybe it's silly to be in love with a space &lt;br&gt;
that belongs to so many before and after, but &lt;br&gt;
sometimes I walk &lt;br&gt;
and smile &lt;br&gt;
as if gold's been poured into my heart and&lt;br&gt;
perhaps there's no reason for this but&lt;br&gt;
that's love isn't it?&lt;br&gt;
we never know why we do.&lt;br&gt;
and I think I can close my eyes at night&lt;br&gt;
and listen to the harmony of the spheres&lt;br&gt;
out there in that velvety infinite &lt;br&gt;
and inside my chest  &lt;br&gt;
everything feels right   &lt;/p&gt;</description><category>mit</category><category>that moment right before the weather gets so cold your fingers fall off</category><category>topographical poetry</category><guid>https://junypr.github.io/junypr-berries/posts/an-ode-to-here/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 03 Oct 2024 00:50:48 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
