The words escape before I register their heartlessness.&lt;br&gt;
They taste of copper pennies and thin blood&lt;br&gt;
like your promises of eternity.&lt;br&gt;
I've freed myself from the shackles of "and,"&lt;br&gt;
"mine" and "yours" no longer;&lt;br&gt;
I exist in singularity,&lt;br&gt;
the period on the last page,&lt;br&gt;
unpaired, but not lonely,&lt;br&gt;
satisfied, with the story,&lt;br&gt;
eager, for the space beyond the back cover.&lt;br&gt;
It's what I needed ---&lt;br&gt;
the starless sky of twilight&lt;br&gt;
to fly as I will&lt;br&gt;
and space to fall.&lt;br&gt;
This I find only alone;&lt;br&gt;
I don't&lt;br&gt;
miss you.  &lt;/p&gt;</description><category>leaving</category><category>love</category><category>missing</category><category>poetry</category><guid>https://junypr.github.io/junypr-berries/posts/i-dont/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 19 Nov 2024 01:01:25 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Boxes</title><link>https://junypr.github.io/junypr-berries/posts/boxes/</link><dc:creator>Alex Ding</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;so simple, in youth &lt;br&gt;
my life poured into jars&lt;br&gt;
I would be a physicist,&lt;br&gt;
then a journalist,&lt;br&gt;
then an engineer,&lt;br&gt;
dreaming of planes&lt;br&gt;
so sure in that jam jar,&lt;br&gt;
the world, seen dimly &lt;br&gt;
through the glass.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so easy, to wrap&lt;br&gt;
my story in a bow&lt;br&gt;
novelist --- tinkerer --- mentor&lt;br&gt;
but was there space in the epics &lt;br&gt;
for poetry? the beret&lt;br&gt;
I never thought I'd don &lt;br&gt;
were there moments to stare &lt;br&gt;
at the sky&lt;br&gt;
connecting the dots of Orion &lt;br&gt;
night after night?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;my life is odds and ends &lt;br&gt;
crammed into the jam jar &lt;br&gt;
of time, I am the &lt;br&gt;
messenger bag against&lt;br&gt;
his back, the&lt;br&gt;
camera bag at my hip, the&lt;br&gt;
wire frames encircling his eyes, the&lt;br&gt;
staff I spin, the&lt;br&gt;
beaver on her lanyard, the&lt;br&gt;
flourish of my marker, the&lt;br&gt;
flecks of solder on the floor, the&lt;br&gt;
things I build and the things I destroy&lt;br&gt;
the worlds I make and unmake in my mind&lt;br&gt;
I do not fit so neatly into boxes.  &lt;/p&gt;</description><category>odds and ends</category><category>poetry</category><guid>https://junypr.github.io/junypr-berries/posts/boxes/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 19 Nov 2024 00:59:53 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Child's Play</title><link>https://junypr.github.io/junypr-berries/posts/childs-play/</link><dc:creator>Alex Ding</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;leaves drift past the concrete facade  &lt;br&gt;

then disappear beneath rubber tires &lt;br&gt;
pulverized&lt;br&gt;
dust and exhaust fumes&lt;br&gt;
I rake the survivors off the ground with my fingertips&lt;br&gt;
bone shards of their skeletons in my hair&lt;br&gt;
I could build a pile big enough to bury a body&lt;br&gt;
if childhood starts when I jump into the first pile of leaves&lt;br&gt;
then can it be said that I was ever a child until now?&lt;br&gt;
if adulthood starts when we first confront death&lt;br&gt;
then can it be said that I was ever an adult until now?&lt;br&gt;

yet in looking finds reason to be appalled &lt;br&gt;
and turn away again &lt;br&gt;
I sleep alone &lt;br&gt;

not in my bed &lt;br&gt;

I strive for the balance of a string plucked into tune &lt;br&gt;

within my mind like feet once walked each week, &lt;br&gt;
and gravel crunching underfoot still brings &lt;br&gt;
the scent of rain-soaked dirt, and tulips raised &lt;br&gt;
in earthen pots like drops of sunlit blood, &lt;br&gt;
and chains of purple blooms to tempt the bees &lt;br&gt;
with springs soft baby's breath. With eyes half closed &lt;br&gt;
the emerald moss that glimmers in stone cracks &lt;br&gt;
bejewels my maple's slender arms, and sun &lt;br&gt;
reflected off the river conjures hoards &lt;br&gt;
of honking geese alighting on the glass &lt;br&gt;
lagoons for meager scraps of bread. Thus fog &lt;br&gt;
unrolled among the concrete crowns &lt;br&gt;
and pillars might unfurl slow over peaks &lt;br&gt;
all blanketed with black green pines, and the &lt;br&gt;
first chills of fall are home's dead winter's cold. &lt;br&gt;
The east is cloaked in a Pacific haze, &lt;br&gt;
and I relive with every breath and step  &lt;br&gt;
and sight the sounds and smells of long-loved home.   &lt;/p&gt;</description><category>blank verse</category><category>home</category><category>poetry</category><category>remembering</category><category>topographical poetry</category><guid>https://junypr.github.io/junypr-berries/posts/superposition/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 12 Nov 2024 01:13:28 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The Aftermath</title><link>https://junypr.github.io/junypr-berries/posts/the-aftermath/</link><dc:creator>Alex Ding</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first Wednesday of November shouldn't be this hot&lt;br&gt;
but the air boils with the rage of half a country wronged &lt;br&gt;
condensed into this microcosm of democracy &lt;br&gt;
--- if we can call it that anymore --- &lt;br&gt;
because when does the permission we gave  &lt;br&gt;
with millions of penned-in circles &lt;br&gt;
become a mandate for something we never spoke?&lt;br&gt;
words drawn from the air that never passed our lips. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://junypr.github.io/junypr-berries/posts/the-aftermath/"&gt;Read more…&lt;/a&gt; (1 min remaining to read)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>election</category><category>poetry</category><category>politics</category><guid>https://junypr.github.io/junypr-berries/posts/the-aftermath/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 12 Nov 2024 01:11:16 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>New Places, Old Faces</title><link>https://junypr.github.io/junypr-berries/posts/new-places-old-faces/</link><dc:creator>Alex Ding</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;Had dinner with you for the first time in years &lt;br&gt;
and now I see you every week  &lt;br&gt;
perhaps with a banana in hand &lt;br&gt;
perhaps rushing to class &lt;br&gt;
and your hair's shorter now &lt;br&gt;
colors I couldn't imagine &lt;br&gt;
but you give me the same smile &lt;br&gt;
that always makes me smile back&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know the feeling of your chest against my back&lt;br&gt;
warmth seeping from body to body &lt;br&gt;
the night you crashed in my room &lt;br&gt;
a brief stop on your way home   &lt;br&gt;
when we exposed our hearts in the way  &lt;br&gt;
we only could with each other   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you're going through what I was a year ago &lt;br&gt;
and perhaps the photos I send cannot convince you that you will, &lt;br&gt;
in fact, make it through &lt;br&gt;
but seeing your silhouette emerge from the fog on the bridge  &lt;br&gt;
sharing the view on the terrace &lt;br&gt;
makes me hope that you, too, will &lt;br&gt;
find hope in a place  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You eat yogurt with cantaloupe &lt;br&gt;
ask us how we're doing &lt;br&gt;
like you did so many mornings back in New Mexico &lt;br&gt;
the heat and blazing sun's gone, but  &lt;br&gt;
How could I forget your voice, homecoming queen?   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the morning you twist on the mattress at the base of my bed &lt;br&gt;
and in an instant I'm taken back to my old room &lt;br&gt;
we stare at the stars and wonder simply how &lt;br&gt;
something that lasted only 39 days  &lt;br&gt;
could be something we miss so dearly.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now my room feels a little colder, alone &lt;br&gt;
your presence lingers here, in my heart  &lt;br&gt;
I'll see you again &lt;br&gt;
so much closer &lt;br&gt;
until next time, my friend   &lt;/p&gt;</description><category>poetry</category><category>the beauty of seeing people I haven't see in a long time</category><guid>https://junypr.github.io/junypr-berries/posts/new-places-old-faces/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 23 Oct 2024 00:37:08 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Part-time Father</title><link>https://junypr.github.io/junypr-berries/posts/part-time-father/</link><dc:creator>Alex Ding</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was five when you left for the first time. Not the two-week business-trip and visiting-family kind of leaving. Not leaving for good, either. You were there one bleak morning, waving goodbye to me through the security lines, steel-gray suitcase and backpack in hand, then gone. House empty. Peaceful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, you and mother call every night. Then every week. Then almost never. The whispers become more like empty screams and I think I hear the phone ring, my mother not picking up, your voice calling for me, me not picking up. I don’t like hearing the screams. I can’t make out the words, but I know what screaming means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We visited your Shanghai apartment that summer, and I remember the drip of chocolate-dipped ice cream cones, the fan thinly fighting the heat, the plastic covering of the bed that wasn’t my own. I dreamed that blood was pouring from every pore in my skin that night, into the fabric of a foreign-not-foreign country that I can and can’t call my home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I was seven when you made the business arrangement. Half your year here, with us, half your year there, in the country I knew in my blood but had never seen. Part-time father, my brother called it. I didn’t know what part-time meant. Or maybe he didn’t.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I draw sketches of you from faded yellow photos, to give when you return. Mother says I’m quite good. A natural-born artist.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

flash and the &lt;br&gt;
boom by  &lt;br&gt;
heartbeats.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;one. &lt;br&gt;
electric-charged late night texts,  &lt;br&gt;
frantic breathing as we listened to the  &lt;br&gt;
rain past the window &lt;br&gt;
curled up in bed, I wrote a letter: &lt;br&gt;
love is a house we build with the one loved --- &lt;br&gt;
I didn't know. did I mean it?  &lt;br&gt;
said I love you because you did   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;two. you painted rose-gold visions of marriage, but  &lt;br&gt;
wouldn't hold my hand &lt;br&gt;
threw me out of the car into the   &lt;br&gt;
pouring rain without a goodbye  &lt;br&gt;
then came begging on your knees for forgiveness, told me  &lt;br&gt;
I love you  &lt;br&gt;
over and over 'til the words tangled into intractable knots  &lt;br&gt;
because you were just the boy  &lt;br&gt;
who ran from the storm to spare his plastic armor from rust, and you &lt;br&gt;
sacrificed me to the goddess of blind hope   &lt;/p&gt;
