within my mind like feet once walked each week, &lt;br&gt;
and gravel crunching underfoot still brings &lt;br&gt;
the scent of rain-soaked dirt, and tulips raised &lt;br&gt;
in earthen pots like drops of sunlit blood, &lt;br&gt;
and chains of purple blooms to tempt the bees &lt;br&gt;
with springs soft baby's breath. With eyes half closed &lt;br&gt;
the emerald moss that glimmers in stone cracks &lt;br&gt;
bejewels my maple's slender arms, and sun &lt;br&gt;
reflected off the river conjures hoards &lt;br&gt;
of honking geese alighting on the glass &lt;br&gt;
lagoons for meager scraps of bread. Thus fog &lt;br&gt;
unrolled among the concrete crowns &lt;br&gt;
and pillars might unfurl slow over peaks &lt;br&gt;
all blanketed with black green pines, and the &lt;br&gt;
first chills of fall are home's dead winter's cold. &lt;br&gt;
The east is cloaked in a Pacific haze, &lt;br&gt;
and I relive with every breath and step  &lt;br&gt;
and sight the sounds and smells of long-loved home.   &lt;/p&gt;</description><category>blank verse</category><category>home</category><category>poetry</category><category>remembering</category><category>topographical poetry</category><guid>https://junypr.github.io/junypr-berries/posts/superposition/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 12 Nov 2024 01:13:28 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>What makes a home</title><link>https://junypr.github.io/junypr-berries/posts/what-makes-a-home/</link><dc:creator>Alex Ding</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;You aren't good at showing it and honestly &lt;br&gt;
neither am I, so I  &lt;br&gt;
choose to write for the moment when  &lt;br&gt;
you return to a house &lt;br&gt;
that will be empty for months as soon as I step &lt;br&gt;
out the door with my luggage kissing this &lt;br&gt;
barren place one last  &lt;br&gt;
good-riddance because it's really not the  &lt;br&gt;
bone-white walls or the  &lt;br&gt;
endless steps or the  &lt;br&gt;
infinite mirrors &lt;br&gt;
I'll miss, because these things don't &lt;br&gt;
make a house home.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't say it anymore, really, but I  &lt;br&gt;
love you and I&lt;br&gt;
will miss you when I &lt;br&gt;
fall asleep on top of a plastic-covered mattress&lt;br&gt;
in a brick-walled building that I  &lt;br&gt;
will eventually learn to call home.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please forgive me if I  &lt;br&gt;
forget to write to reassure you that I &lt;br&gt;
am in fact alive and have taken out &lt;br&gt;
my contacts for the night. I know you &lt;br&gt;
ask because you care.   &lt;/p&gt;</description><category>home</category><category>letters I never sent and never will</category><category>topographical poetry</category><guid>https://junypr.github.io/junypr-berries/posts/what-makes-a-home/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 05 Oct 2024 19:54:21 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>It's fall</title><link>https://junypr.github.io/junypr-berries/posts/its-fall/</link><dc:creator>Alex Ding</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;My mother said the changing autumn leaves filled her with melancholy &lt;br&gt;
perhaps that is why she chose California  &lt;br&gt;
where summer slips into winter in ever dimming shades of green  &lt;br&gt;
like a photo drained of color until nothing is left but grey &lt;br&gt;
so smoothly that one never stops to realize the moment  &lt;br&gt;
in which what was had is no longer what you have   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here I hurtle towards the brink of winter &lt;br&gt;
desperate to hold onto these last moments in the sun   &lt;br&gt;
watching it sink through my open window  &lt;br&gt;
so painfully aware of what I have  &lt;br&gt;
and am soon to lose &lt;br&gt;
it falls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I watch sunlight illuminate patches of a bride's dress &lt;br&gt;
pinkies reaching, interlocking, a wedding ring  &lt;br&gt;
hands pressed palm to palm, a girl speaks Spanish on the phone  &lt;br&gt;
a blushing leaf flutters like a yellow swallowtail &lt;br&gt;
the toddler doesn't quite catch it &lt;br&gt;
it falls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The breeze swirls the leaves like a painter's brush  &lt;br&gt;
I want to dance a dance of grief   &lt;br&gt;
sun over the Charles glows golden through the clouds  &lt;br&gt;
and warm on the back of my neck  &lt;br&gt;
crabapple nestled in the leaves &lt;br&gt;
it falls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I observe like I did this morning through glass &lt;br&gt;
when the face I saw while folding laundry smiled back and waved &lt;br&gt;
and I tried to catch him on the stairs but was too late &lt;br&gt;
I see you. I know you.&lt;br&gt;
I am here. I tell myself I belong. &lt;br&gt;
it's fall. &lt;/p&gt;</description><category>autumn</category><category>just waiting for the seasonal affective disorder to set in</category><category>topographical poetry</category><guid>https://junypr.github.io/junypr-berries/posts/its-fall/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 05 Oct 2024 19:44:07 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>An Ode to Here</title><link>https://junypr.github.io/junypr-berries/posts/an-ode-to-here/</link><dc:creator>Alex Ding</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;When I came here I thought I'd &lt;br&gt;
fall in love again --- I mean &lt;br&gt;
read the blogs, hear the babies, hold the healed hearts &lt;br&gt;
and you'd think it'd be the same --- but&lt;br&gt;
I didn't think I'd fall in love with this sense of place&lt;br&gt;
Some home we have &lt;br&gt;
Killian in the afternoon on this statue &lt;br&gt;
of frozen granite speckled by  &lt;br&gt;
the last rays of this summer's sun who we'll  &lt;br&gt;
bid adieu in a few short hours &lt;br&gt;
unprepared for the drudge through icy darkness, and &lt;br&gt;
infinite corridors and labyrinthine tunnels and &lt;br&gt;
maybe it's silly to be in love with a space &lt;br&gt;
that belongs to so many before and after, but &lt;br&gt;
sometimes I walk &lt;br&gt;
and smile &lt;br&gt;
as if gold's been poured into my heart and&lt;br&gt;
perhaps there's no reason for this but&lt;br&gt;
that's love isn't it?&lt;br&gt;
we never know why we do.&lt;br&gt;
and I think I can close my eyes at night&lt;br&gt;
and listen to the harmony of the spheres&lt;br&gt;
out there in that velvety infinite &lt;br&gt;
and inside my chest  &lt;br&gt;
everything feels right   &lt;/p&gt;</description><category>mit</category><category>that moment right before the weather gets so cold your fingers fall off</category><category>topographical poetry</category><guid>https://junypr.github.io/junypr-berries/posts/an-ode-to-here/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 03 Oct 2024 00:50:48 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
