fall in love again --- I mean &lt;br&gt;
read the blogs, hear the babies, hold the healed hearts &lt;br&gt;
and you'd think it'd be the same --- but&lt;br&gt;
I didn't think I'd fall in love with this sense of place&lt;br&gt;
Some home we have &lt;br&gt;
Killian in the afternoon on this statue &lt;br&gt;
of frozen granite speckled by  &lt;br&gt;
the last rays of this summer's sun who we'll  &lt;br&gt;
bid adieu in a few short hours &lt;br&gt;
unprepared for the drudge through icy darkness, and &lt;br&gt;
infinite corridors and labyrinthine tunnels and &lt;br&gt;
maybe it's silly to be in love with a space &lt;br&gt;
that belongs to so many before and after, but &lt;br&gt;
sometimes I walk &lt;br&gt;
and smile &lt;br&gt;
as if gold's been poured into my heart and&lt;br&gt;
perhaps there's no reason for this but&lt;br&gt;
that's love isn't it?&lt;br&gt;
we never know why we do.&lt;br&gt;
and I think I can close my eyes at night&lt;br&gt;
and listen to the harmony of the spheres&lt;br&gt;
out there in that velvety infinite &lt;br&gt;
and inside my chest  &lt;br&gt;
everything feels right   &lt;/p&gt;</description><category>mit</category><category>that moment right before the weather gets so cold your fingers fall off</category><category>topographical poetry</category><guid>https://junypr.github.io/junypr-berries/posts/an-ode-to-here/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 03 Oct 2024 00:50:48 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
