torn off and paint their walls lime green to piss off the neighbors. 
the man upends a bag of sandwich crumbs, shoos the ducks back their 
side of the fence with steel-toed boot stomps. simple equation: good 
fences equal good neighbors. the ducks slide underneath. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;two. mother who mistook you for a proper chinese child who learned 
their mother tongue in the crib like hers, now in college. hao ya zi. 
awkward american accent: yeah. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;three. not-man-not-woman-not-neither-maybe-all-of-the-above. cropped 
blonde hair makes them look like your colead. olive bomber jacket, lanky 
legs, might be your classmate. someone from your past. who you want to 
be in the future. they run like they're being tailed. maybe by you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;four. young couple, not holding hands, but she bumps against him, the cuff 
of her sleek leather jacket touching his jeans. he is forgettable beyond 
belief, your eyes slide to the ducks crossing the sidewalk. her black hair 
is pulled into a stubby ponytail, she looks like the photos of you. you 
follow. you never see her face, but you don't want to, you think. in case 
she looks like you.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>home</category><category>musings on an ordinary day</category><category>strangers</category><guid>https://junypr.github.io/junypr-berries/posts/the-four-people-you-meet-by-the-pond/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 05 Oct 2024 19:49:49 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
