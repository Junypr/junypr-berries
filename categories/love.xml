flash and the &lt;br&gt;
boom by  &lt;br&gt;
heartbeats.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;one. &lt;br&gt;
electric-charged late night texts,  &lt;br&gt;
frantic breathing as we listened to the  &lt;br&gt;
rain past the window &lt;br&gt;
curled up in bed, I wrote a letter: &lt;br&gt;
love is a house we build with the one loved --- &lt;br&gt;
I didn't know. did I mean it?  &lt;br&gt;
said I love you because you did   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;two. you painted rose-gold visions of marriage, but  &lt;br&gt;
wouldn't hold my hand &lt;br&gt;
threw me out of the car into the   &lt;br&gt;
pouring rain without a goodbye  &lt;br&gt;
then came begging on your knees for forgiveness, told me  &lt;br&gt;
I love you  &lt;br&gt;
over and over 'til the words tangled into intractable knots  &lt;br&gt;
because you were just the boy  &lt;br&gt;
who ran from the storm to spare his plastic armor from rust, and you &lt;br&gt;
sacrificed me to the goddess of blind hope   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;three. endless summer nights pining  &lt;br&gt;
writing before the sun caught up to my darkest secrets &lt;br&gt;
dancing in the soaking rain 'til I shook in the shock  &lt;br&gt;
of the hazy scent after the storm &lt;br&gt;
love blurred with lust &lt;br&gt;
'til I couldn't draw the lines straight &lt;br&gt;
under starless skies I traded the king for a pawn   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;four. when you denied your wooden words &lt;br&gt;
I realized I had forgotten how to speak.  &lt;br&gt;
for you, I tamed your insecurities, but you  &lt;br&gt;
dismissed my fears, painted over &lt;br&gt;
my dreams with your prophecies, told me  &lt;br&gt;
my problems were imaginary, said  &lt;br&gt;
I was loved as I was lost, bound  &lt;br&gt;
my wings to a cage that I told myself  &lt;br&gt;
felt like home&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;five. thought I'd miss you in my month away &lt;br&gt;
but I couldn't  &lt;br&gt;
bring myself to yearn for you when I  &lt;br&gt;
found freedom in &lt;br&gt;
solitary sunsets, in &lt;br&gt;
stranger-filled subway rides, in &lt;br&gt;
hands warmer than yours, in &lt;br&gt;
rain pouring down the gorge &lt;br&gt;
through whitewashed towns you couldn't name &lt;br&gt;
nor remember  &lt;br&gt;
washing away the dust, for once giving me &lt;br&gt;
clean air to breathe   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;six. lightening strike  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;maybe it's just my mind&lt;br&gt;
regressing 
memory under reconstruction&lt;br&gt;
of once-perfect moments &lt;br&gt;
staring into your eyes under your sheets &lt;br&gt;
by the creek, hands on my skin &lt;br&gt;
now I wince at the cold &lt;br&gt;
your hearth scorches &lt;br&gt;
your shelter from the storm&lt;br&gt;
became a prison &lt;br&gt;
you forgot to wear gloves when you caught this falcon &lt;br&gt;
her claws draw blood &lt;br&gt;
her heart yearns for the skies   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So forgive me if I no longer respond &lt;br&gt;
if I can't tell you that I love you &lt;br&gt;
I've shredded the love letters &lt;br&gt;
burned the past &lt;br&gt;
swept the ashes into the street &lt;br&gt;
let the the rain wash it away  &lt;br&gt;
the water set me free   &lt;/p&gt;</description><category>leaving</category><category>love</category><category>poetry</category><guid>https://junypr.github.io/junypr-berries/posts/lightning-heartbeat/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 23 Oct 2024 00:03:43 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Star-</title><link>https://junypr.github.io/junypr-berries/posts/star-/</link><dc:creator>Alex Ding</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;star-gazing star-struck  &lt;br&gt;
on that starry night I was the  &lt;br&gt;
shooting star burning in your  &lt;br&gt;
atmosphere of dark nights   &lt;br&gt;
bus rides through deserts  &lt;br&gt;
head on your shoulder fits  &lt;br&gt;
last-puzzle-piece-perfect &lt;br&gt;
fingers in your hair  &lt;br&gt;
where soft sharp sand sleeps still, I think  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;star-spun binary dance &lt;br&gt;
thumb across my hand&lt;br&gt;
silent mountain shade &lt;br&gt;
late nights flickering flashlights &lt;br&gt;
dodging cockroaches, grasshoppers &lt;br&gt;
twirl me til we crash &lt;br&gt;
let me forget that we were   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;star-crossed short-lived &lt;br&gt;
supernova burning &lt;br&gt;
sweets keyboard clicks card-shuffles &lt;br&gt;
endless days, momentary weeks &lt;br&gt;
torn from the star-strewn inky blackness &lt;br&gt;
until we were thrown back   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;star-struck opportune collision &lt;br&gt;
you picked at rabbit bones &lt;br&gt;
thought I could lace my fingers through yours &lt;br&gt;
keep your hand on my waist through  &lt;br&gt;
Madrid mornings Ronda  &lt;br&gt;
sunsets Alhambra sunrises home to the  &lt;br&gt;
pond-side park bench where I watch  &lt;br&gt;
coots feed their young, alone   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so I look to the sky and ask &lt;br&gt;
do you see the same &lt;br&gt;
stars we saw in New Mexico?&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>astronomy</category><category>love</category><category>things I write because I need to</category><guid>https://junypr.github.io/junypr-berries/posts/star-/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 06 Oct 2024 02:02:32 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Paint and Grease</title><link>https://junypr.github.io/junypr-berries/posts/paint-and-grease/</link><dc:creator>Alex Ding</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;Accident was the yellow-black taxi stopped &lt;br&gt;
at your workshop. Heart-stopped —  &lt;br&gt;
it wasn’t my studio. Heartless  &lt;br&gt;
December snow trampled into metal chips &lt;br&gt;
under your boots. Paint chips  &lt;br&gt;
under my nails. You liked them. &lt;br&gt;
Maybe you’d like them painted. &lt;br&gt;
Chance was the storm keeping me with you.  &lt;br&gt;
No excuse. You handed me pliers,  &lt;br&gt;
a wrench. Taught me to weld like maybe I’d mend  &lt;br&gt;
your broken heart. Broken engine part.  &lt;br&gt;
Rose was the flush of your cheeks  &lt;br&gt;
when I brushed you. Breath-caught beauty, &lt;br&gt;
that in building two men  &lt;br&gt;
can be uncomfortably close. Beauty, &lt;br&gt;
in being comfortingly close. &lt;br&gt;
When the storm cleared &lt;br&gt;
you bloomed like a rose in the painting  &lt;br&gt;
I made of your crimson-navy swirls  &lt;br&gt;
indigo splatters and flecks of white.  &lt;br&gt;
In attic sunlight, gauze curtains drawn, &lt;br&gt;
you were my masterpiece. I, the mastermind.  &lt;br&gt;
Maybe I loaded the dice. Maybe weighted coins land  &lt;br&gt;
headfirst. Maybe I was sprinting headfirst &lt;br&gt;
to keep you by my side. &lt;br&gt;
And if I smelled like machine grease,  &lt;br&gt;
and you did too.  &lt;br&gt;
And if you smelled like acrylic paint,  &lt;br&gt;
and I did too. &lt;br&gt;
It would only be coincidence.    &lt;/p&gt;</description><category>art</category><category>love</category><category>machines</category><category>not autobiographical</category><category>things I write because I can</category><guid>https://junypr.github.io/junypr-berries/posts/paint-and-grease/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 05 Oct 2024 19:52:21 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
