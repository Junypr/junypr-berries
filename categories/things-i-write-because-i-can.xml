&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;She stared from the hemp hammock with silver eyes matching mine. Except there wasn’t a star burning within, just the leaden shine of the three moons through the hut’s reed roof. She resembled me, it was true. The same abyssal hair flecked with stars, the same galaxial swirls dancing across her skin. Even the same flowing robes licked with violet flames, woven from the gasps of a dying star.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The villager with the sun-washed chest and shell-bead necklace smiled. “She told us to expect you.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Expect me?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It started with darkness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s dark in the space between the stars. It’s dark, and it’s cold, and it’s empty, and it’s where I go to clear my head. I float, where time and space freeze, watching the planets hum their endless melodies, watching newborn stars gasp their first breaths or dying ones scream their last. When I tire of the infinite lights, I close my eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My name is Eva Cloudstrider, I mold the fabric of space and time, and I don’t know why I’m here. Maybe if I listen long enough, I’ll find out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All I hear is a scream. A scream that winds around me until I’m caught in its embrace. A scream that tugs, ever stronger, until I take a step and time spins and spools and falls away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m on a beach. The sand like stars again skin darker than the end of time, the waves a kiss upon milky cheeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scream is louder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scream is death.&lt;/p&gt;

at your workshop. Heart-stopped —  &lt;br&gt;
it wasn’t my studio. Heartless  &lt;br&gt;
December snow trampled into metal chips &lt;br&gt;
under your boots. Paint chips  &lt;br&gt;
under my nails. You liked them. &lt;br&gt;
Maybe you’d like them painted. &lt;br&gt;
Chance was the storm keeping me with you.  &lt;br&gt;
No excuse. You handed me pliers,  &lt;br&gt;
a wrench. Taught me to weld like maybe I’d mend  &lt;br&gt;
your broken heart. Broken engine part.  &lt;br&gt;
Rose was the flush of your cheeks  &lt;br&gt;
when I brushed you. Breath-caught beauty, &lt;br&gt;
that in building two men  &lt;br&gt;
can be uncomfortably close. Beauty, &lt;br&gt;
in being comfortingly close. &lt;br&gt;
When the storm cleared &lt;br&gt;
you bloomed like a rose in the painting  &lt;br&gt;
I made of your crimson-navy swirls  &lt;br&gt;
indigo splatters and flecks of white.  &lt;br&gt;
In attic sunlight, gauze curtains drawn, &lt;br&gt;
you were my masterpiece. I, the mastermind.  &lt;br&gt;
Maybe I loaded the dice. Maybe weighted coins land  &lt;br&gt;
headfirst. Maybe I was sprinting headfirst &lt;br&gt;
to keep you by my side. &lt;br&gt;
And if I smelled like machine grease,  &lt;br&gt;
and you did too.  &lt;br&gt;
And if you smelled like acrylic paint,  &lt;br&gt;
and I did too. &lt;br&gt;
It would only be coincidence.    &lt;/p&gt;</description><category>art</category><category>love</category><category>machines</category><category>not autobiographical</category><category>things I write because I can</category><guid>https://junypr.github.io/junypr-berries/posts/paint-and-grease/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 05 Oct 2024 19:52:21 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
