and now I see you every week  &lt;br&gt;
perhaps with a banana in hand &lt;br&gt;
perhaps rushing to class &lt;br&gt;
and your hair's shorter now &lt;br&gt;
colors I couldn't imagine &lt;br&gt;
but you give me the same smile &lt;br&gt;
that always makes me smile back&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know the feeling of your chest against my back&lt;br&gt;
warmth seeping from body to body &lt;br&gt;
the night you crashed in my room &lt;br&gt;
a brief stop on your way home   &lt;br&gt;
when we exposed our hearts in the way  &lt;br&gt;
we only could with each other   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you're going through what I was a year ago &lt;br&gt;
and perhaps the photos I send cannot convince you that you will, &lt;br&gt;
in fact, make it through &lt;br&gt;
but seeing your silhouette emerge from the fog on the bridge  &lt;br&gt;
sharing the view on the terrace &lt;br&gt;
makes me hope that you, too, will &lt;br&gt;
find hope in a place  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You eat yogurt with cantaloupe &lt;br&gt;
ask us how we're doing &lt;br&gt;
like you did so many mornings back in New Mexico &lt;br&gt;
the heat and blazing sun's gone, but  &lt;br&gt;
How could I forget your voice, homecoming queen?   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the morning you twist on the mattress at the base of my bed &lt;br&gt;
and in an instant I'm taken back to my old room &lt;br&gt;
we stare at the stars and wonder simply how &lt;br&gt;
something that lasted only 39 days  &lt;br&gt;
could be something we miss so dearly.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now my room feels a little colder, alone &lt;br&gt;
your presence lingers here, in my heart  &lt;br&gt;
I'll see you again &lt;br&gt;
so much closer &lt;br&gt;
until next time, my friend   &lt;/p&gt;</description><category>poetry</category><category>the beauty of seeing people I haven't see in a long time</category><guid>https://junypr.github.io/junypr-berries/posts/new-places-old-faces/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 23 Oct 2024 00:37:08 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Lightning Heartbeat</title><link>https://junypr.github.io/junypr-berries/posts/lightning-heartbeat/</link><dc:creator>Alex Ding</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I count the space between the &lt;br&gt;
flash and the &lt;br&gt;
boom by  &lt;br&gt;
heartbeats.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;one. &lt;br&gt;
electric-charged late night texts,  &lt;br&gt;
frantic breathing as we listened to the  &lt;br&gt;
rain past the window &lt;br&gt;
curled up in bed, I wrote a letter: &lt;br&gt;
love is a house we build with the one loved --- &lt;br&gt;
I didn't know. did I mean it?  &lt;br&gt;
said I love you because you did   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;two. you painted rose-gold visions of marriage, but  &lt;br&gt;
wouldn't hold my hand &lt;br&gt;
threw me out of the car into the   &lt;br&gt;
pouring rain without a goodbye  &lt;br&gt;
then came begging on your knees for forgiveness, told me  &lt;br&gt;
I love you  &lt;br&gt;
over and over 'til the words tangled into intractable knots  &lt;br&gt;
because you were just the boy  &lt;br&gt;
who ran from the storm to spare his plastic armor from rust, and you &lt;br&gt;
sacrificed me to the goddess of blind hope   &lt;/p&gt;

on that starry night I was the  &lt;br&gt;
shooting star burning in your  &lt;br&gt;
atmosphere of dark nights   &lt;br&gt;
bus rides through deserts  &lt;br&gt;
head on your shoulder fits  &lt;br&gt;
last-puzzle-piece-perfect &lt;br&gt;
fingers in your hair  &lt;br&gt;
where soft sharp sand sleeps still, I think  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;star-spun binary dance &lt;br&gt;
thumb across my hand&lt;br&gt;
silent mountain shade &lt;br&gt;
late nights flickering flashlights &lt;br&gt;
dodging cockroaches, grasshoppers &lt;br&gt;
twirl me til we crash &lt;br&gt;
let me forget that we were   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;star-crossed short-lived &lt;br&gt;
supernova burning &lt;br&gt;
sweets keyboard clicks card-shuffles &lt;br&gt;
endless days, momentary weeks &lt;br&gt;
torn from the star-strewn inky blackness &lt;br&gt;
until we were thrown back   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;star-struck opportune collision &lt;br&gt;
you picked at rabbit bones &lt;br&gt;
thought I could lace my fingers through yours &lt;br&gt;
keep your hand on my waist through  &lt;br&gt;
Madrid mornings Ronda  &lt;br&gt;
sunsets Alhambra sunrises home to the  &lt;br&gt;
pond-side park bench where I watch  &lt;br&gt;
coots feed their young, alone   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so I look to the sky and ask &lt;br&gt;
do you see the same &lt;br&gt;
stars we saw in New Mexico?&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>astronomy</category><category>love</category><category>things I write because I need to</category><guid>https://junypr.github.io/junypr-berries/posts/star-/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 06 Oct 2024 02:02:32 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>What makes a home</title><link>https://junypr.github.io/junypr-berries/posts/what-makes-a-home/</link><dc:creator>Alex Ding</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;You aren't good at showing it and honestly &lt;br&gt;
neither am I, so I  &lt;br&gt;
choose to write for the moment when  &lt;br&gt;
you return to a house &lt;br&gt;
that will be empty for months as soon as I step &lt;br&gt;
out the door with my luggage kissing this &lt;br&gt;
barren place one last  &lt;br&gt;
good-riddance because it's really not the  &lt;br&gt;
bone-white walls or the  &lt;br&gt;
endless steps or the  &lt;br&gt;
infinite mirrors &lt;br&gt;
I'll miss, because these things don't &lt;br&gt;
make a house home.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't say it anymore, really, but I  &lt;br&gt;
love you and I&lt;br&gt;
will miss you when I &lt;br&gt;
fall asleep on top of a plastic-covered mattress&lt;br&gt;
in a brick-walled building that I  &lt;br&gt;
will eventually learn to call home.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please forgive me if I  &lt;br&gt;
forget to write to reassure you that I &lt;br&gt;
am in fact alive and have taken out &lt;br&gt;
my contacts for the night. I know you &lt;br&gt;
ask because you care.   &lt;/p&gt;</description><category>home</category><category>letters I never sent and never will</category><category>topographical poetry</category><guid>https://junypr.github.io/junypr-berries/posts/what-makes-a-home/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 05 Oct 2024 19:54:21 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Paint and Grease</title><link>https://junypr.github.io/junypr-berries/posts/paint-and-grease/</link><dc:creator>Alex Ding</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;Accident was the yellow-black taxi stopped &lt;br&gt;
at your workshop. Heart-stopped —  &lt;br&gt;
it wasn’t my studio. Heartless  &lt;br&gt;
December snow trampled into metal chips &lt;br&gt;
under your boots. Paint chips  &lt;br&gt;
under my nails. You liked them. &lt;br&gt;
Maybe you’d like them painted. &lt;br&gt;
Chance was the storm keeping me with you.  &lt;br&gt;
No excuse. You handed me pliers,  &lt;br&gt;
a wrench. Taught me to weld like maybe I’d mend  &lt;br&gt;
your broken heart. Broken engine part.  &lt;br&gt;
Rose was the flush of your cheeks  &lt;br&gt;
when I brushed you. Breath-caught beauty, &lt;br&gt;
that in building two men  &lt;br&gt;
can be uncomfortably close. Beauty, &lt;br&gt;
in being comfortingly close. &lt;br&gt;
When the storm cleared &lt;br&gt;
you bloomed like a rose in the painting  &lt;br&gt;
I made of your crimson-navy swirls  &lt;br&gt;
indigo splatters and flecks of white.  &lt;br&gt;
In attic sunlight, gauze curtains drawn, &lt;br&gt;
you were my masterpiece. I, the mastermind.  &lt;br&gt;
Maybe I loaded the dice. Maybe weighted coins land  &lt;br&gt;
headfirst. Maybe I was sprinting headfirst &lt;br&gt;
to keep you by my side. &lt;br&gt;
And if I smelled like machine grease,  &lt;br&gt;
and you did too.  &lt;br&gt;
And if you smelled like acrylic paint,  &lt;br&gt;
and I did too. &lt;br&gt;
It would only be coincidence.    &lt;/p&gt;</description><category>art</category><category>love</category><category>machines</category><category>not autobiographical</category><category>things I write because I can</category><guid>https://junypr.github.io/junypr-berries/posts/paint-and-grease/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 05 Oct 2024 19:52:21 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>It's fall</title><link>https://junypr.github.io/junypr-berries/posts/its-fall/</link><dc:creator>Alex Ding</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;My mother said the changing autumn leaves filled her with melancholy &lt;br&gt;
perhaps that is why she chose California  &lt;br&gt;
where summer slips into winter in ever dimming shades of green  &lt;br&gt;
like a photo drained of color until nothing is left but grey &lt;br&gt;
so smoothly that one never stops to realize the moment  &lt;br&gt;
in which what was had is no longer what you have   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here I hurtle towards the brink of winter &lt;br&gt;
desperate to hold onto these last moments in the sun   &lt;br&gt;
watching it sink through my open window  &lt;br&gt;
so painfully aware of what I have  &lt;br&gt;
and am soon to lose &lt;br&gt;
it falls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I watch sunlight illuminate patches of a bride's dress &lt;br&gt;
pinkies reaching, interlocking, a wedding ring  &lt;br&gt;
hands pressed palm to palm, a girl speaks Spanish on the phone  &lt;br&gt;
a blushing leaf flutters like a yellow swallowtail &lt;br&gt;
the toddler doesn't quite catch it &lt;br&gt;
it falls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The breeze swirls the leaves like a painter's brush  &lt;br&gt;
I want to dance a dance of grief   &lt;br&gt;
sun over the Charles glows golden through the clouds  &lt;br&gt;
and warm on the back of my neck  &lt;br&gt;
crabapple nestled in the leaves &lt;br&gt;
it falls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I observe like I did this morning through glass &lt;br&gt;
when the face I saw while folding laundry smiled back and waved &lt;br&gt;
and I tried to catch him on the stairs but was too late &lt;br&gt;
I see you. I know you.&lt;br&gt;
I am here. I tell myself I belong. &lt;br&gt;
it's fall. &lt;/p&gt;</description><category>autumn</category><category>just waiting for the seasonal affective disorder to set in</category><category>topographical poetry</category><guid>https://junypr.github.io/junypr-berries/posts/its-fall/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 05 Oct 2024 19:44:07 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>An Ode to Here</title><link>https://junypr.github.io/junypr-berries/posts/an-ode-to-here/</link><dc:creator>Alex Ding</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;When I came here I thought I'd &lt;br&gt;
fall in love again --- I mean &lt;br&gt;
read the blogs, hear the babies, hold the healed hearts &lt;br&gt;
and you'd think it'd be the same --- but&lt;br&gt;
I didn't think I'd fall in love with this sense of place&lt;br&gt;
Some home we have &lt;br&gt;
Killian in the afternoon on this statue &lt;br&gt;
of frozen granite speckled by  &lt;br&gt;
the last rays of this summer's sun who we'll  &lt;br&gt;
bid adieu in a few short hours &lt;br&gt;
unprepared for the drudge through icy darkness, and &lt;br&gt;
infinite corridors and labyrinthine tunnels and &lt;br&gt;
maybe it's silly to be in love with a space &lt;br&gt;
that belongs to so many before and after, but &lt;br&gt;
sometimes I walk &lt;br&gt;
and smile &lt;br&gt;
as if gold's been poured into my heart and&lt;br&gt;
perhaps there's no reason for this but&lt;br&gt;
that's love isn't it?&lt;br&gt;
we never know why we do.&lt;br&gt;
and I think I can close my eyes at night&lt;br&gt;
and listen to the harmony of the spheres&lt;br&gt;
out there in that velvety infinite &lt;br&gt;
and inside my chest  &lt;br&gt;
everything feels right   &lt;/p&gt;</description><category>mit</category><category>that moment right before the weather gets so cold your fingers fall off</category><category>topographical poetry</category><guid>https://junypr.github.io/junypr-berries/posts/an-ode-to-here/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 03 Oct 2024 00:50:48 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Taxidermy</title><link>https://junypr.github.io/junypr-berries/posts/taxidermy/</link><dc:creator>Alex Ding</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;I am a bird sliced  &lt;br&gt;

scarlet feathers at my throat  &lt;br&gt;
heart torn out   &lt;br&gt;
emerald wings pinned in place  &lt;br&gt;
preserved perfection  &lt;br&gt;
