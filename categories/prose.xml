Not the two-week business-trip and visiting-family kind of leaving. Not leaving for good, either. You were there one bleak morning, waving goodbye to me through the security lines, steel-gray suitcase and backpack in hand, then gone. House empty. Peaceful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, you and mother call every night. Then every week. Then almost never. The whispers become more like empty screams and I think I hear the phone ring, my mother not picking up, your voice calling for me, me not picking up. I don’t like hearing the screams. I can’t make out the words, but I know what screaming means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We visited your Shanghai apartment that summer, and I remember the drip of chocolate-dipped ice cream cones, the fan thinly fighting the heat, the plastic covering of the bed that wasn’t my own. I dreamed that blood was pouring from every pore in my skin that night, into the fabric of a foreign-not-foreign country that I can and can’t call my home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I was seven when you made the business arrangement. Half your year here, with us, half your year there, in the country I knew in my blood but had never seen. Part-time father, my brother called it. I didn’t know what part-time meant. Or maybe he didn’t.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I draw sketches of you from faded yellow photos, to give when you return. Mother says I’m quite good. A natural-born artist.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

So I grab my camera and fly down the stairs, 
I don't stop to say hello because something inside my chest tells me that this is what matters, 
that I need to be here, 
breath catching in the crisp fall air as I watch the last glimmers of sunlight fade over the Charles 
and burnish the glass skyscrapers of Boston's skyline gold. 
Something within me finds peace as my eyes ascend the gradient of soft pink blushes and orange streaks into the wash of 
cyan above. Something tells me that I must hold onto this the way I cling to the rail's flaking paint. 
Something tells me this beauty will never be repeated.
Whether this moment brings me joy or brings me to my knees, 
whether the shimmer is fool's gold or true, 
I have only this moment. 
Like sunsets, nothing lasts forever. 
What is there to be done but to enjoy it?&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>prose</category><category>random thoughts</category><category>sunsets</category><guid>https://junypr.github.io/junypr-berries/posts/the-thing-about-sunsets/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 22 Oct 2024 23:56:30 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
