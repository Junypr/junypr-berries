and now I see you every week  &lt;br&gt;
perhaps with a banana in hand &lt;br&gt;
perhaps rushing to class &lt;br&gt;
and your hair's shorter now &lt;br&gt;
colors I couldn't imagine &lt;br&gt;
but you give me the same smile &lt;br&gt;
that always makes me smile back&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know the feeling of your chest against my back&lt;br&gt;
warmth seeping from body to body &lt;br&gt;
the night you crashed in my room &lt;br&gt;
a brief stop on your way home   &lt;br&gt;
when we exposed our hearts in the way  &lt;br&gt;
we only could with each other   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you're going through what I was a year ago &lt;br&gt;
and perhaps the photos I send cannot convince you that you will, &lt;br&gt;
in fact, make it through &lt;br&gt;
but seeing your silhouette emerge from the fog on the bridge  &lt;br&gt;
sharing the view on the terrace &lt;br&gt;
makes me hope that you, too, will &lt;br&gt;
find hope in a place  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You eat yogurt with cantaloupe &lt;br&gt;
ask us how we're doing &lt;br&gt;
like you did so many mornings back in New Mexico &lt;br&gt;
the heat and blazing sun's gone, but  &lt;br&gt;
How could I forget your voice, homecoming queen?   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the morning you twist on the mattress at the base of my bed &lt;br&gt;
and in an instant I'm taken back to my old room &lt;br&gt;
we stare at the stars and wonder simply how &lt;br&gt;
something that lasted only 39 days  &lt;br&gt;
could be something we miss so dearly.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now my room feels a little colder, alone &lt;br&gt;
your presence lingers here, in my heart  &lt;br&gt;
I'll see you again &lt;br&gt;
so much closer &lt;br&gt;
until next time, my friend   &lt;/p&gt;</description><category>poetry</category><category>the beauty of seeing people I haven't see in a long time</category><guid>https://junypr.github.io/junypr-berries/posts/new-places-old-faces/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 23 Oct 2024 00:37:08 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
