at your workshop. Heart-stopped —  &lt;br&gt;
it wasn’t my studio. Heartless  &lt;br&gt;
December snow trampled into metal chips &lt;br&gt;
under your boots. Paint chips  &lt;br&gt;
under my nails. You liked them. &lt;br&gt;
Maybe you’d like them painted. &lt;br&gt;
Chance was the storm keeping me with you.  &lt;br&gt;
No excuse. You handed me pliers,  &lt;br&gt;
a wrench. Taught me to weld like maybe I’d mend  &lt;br&gt;
your broken heart. Broken engine part.  &lt;br&gt;
Rose was the flush of your cheeks  &lt;br&gt;
when I brushed you. Breath-caught beauty, &lt;br&gt;
that in building two men  &lt;br&gt;
can be uncomfortably close. Beauty, &lt;br&gt;
in being comfortingly close. &lt;br&gt;
When the storm cleared &lt;br&gt;
you bloomed like a rose in the painting  &lt;br&gt;
I made of your crimson-navy swirls  &lt;br&gt;
indigo splatters and flecks of white.  &lt;br&gt;
In attic sunlight, gauze curtains drawn, &lt;br&gt;
you were my masterpiece. I, the mastermind.  &lt;br&gt;
Maybe I loaded the dice. Maybe weighted coins land  &lt;br&gt;
headfirst. Maybe I was sprinting headfirst &lt;br&gt;
to keep you by my side. &lt;br&gt;
And if I smelled like machine grease,  &lt;br&gt;
and you did too.  &lt;br&gt;
And if you smelled like acrylic paint,  &lt;br&gt;
and I did too. &lt;br&gt;
It would only be coincidence.    &lt;/p&gt;</description><category>art</category><category>love</category><category>machines</category><category>not autobiographical</category><category>things I write because I can</category><guid>https://junypr.github.io/junypr-berries/posts/paint-and-grease/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 05 Oct 2024 19:52:21 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
