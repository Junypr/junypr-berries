flash and the &lt;br&gt;
boom by  &lt;br&gt;
heartbeats.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;one. &lt;br&gt;
electric-charged late night texts,  &lt;br&gt;
frantic breathing as we listened to the  &lt;br&gt;
rain past the window &lt;br&gt;
curled up in bed, I wrote a letter: &lt;br&gt;
love is a house we build with the one loved --- &lt;br&gt;
I didn't know. did I mean it?  &lt;br&gt;
said I love you because you did   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;two. you painted rose-gold visions of marriage, but  &lt;br&gt;
wouldn't hold my hand &lt;br&gt;
threw me out of the car into the   &lt;br&gt;
pouring rain without a goodbye  &lt;br&gt;
then came begging on your knees for forgiveness, told me  &lt;br&gt;
I love you  &lt;br&gt;
over and over 'til the words tangled into intractable knots  &lt;br&gt;
because you were just the boy  &lt;br&gt;
who ran from the storm to spare his plastic armor from rust, and you &lt;br&gt;
sacrificed me to the goddess of blind hope   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;three. endless summer nights pining  &lt;br&gt;
writing before the sun caught up to my darkest secrets &lt;br&gt;
dancing in the soaking rain 'til I shook in the shock  &lt;br&gt;
of the hazy scent after the storm &lt;br&gt;
love blurred with lust &lt;br&gt;
'til I couldn't draw the lines straight &lt;br&gt;
under starless skies I traded the king for a pawn   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;four. when you denied your wooden words &lt;br&gt;
I realized I had forgotten how to speak.  &lt;br&gt;
for you, I tamed your insecurities, but you  &lt;br&gt;
dismissed my fears, painted over &lt;br&gt;
my dreams with your prophecies, told me  &lt;br&gt;
my problems were imaginary, said  &lt;br&gt;
I was loved as I was lost, bound  &lt;br&gt;
my wings to a cage that I told myself  &lt;br&gt;
felt like home&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;five. thought I'd miss you in my month away &lt;br&gt;
but I couldn't  &lt;br&gt;
bring myself to yearn for you when I  &lt;br&gt;
found freedom in &lt;br&gt;
solitary sunsets, in &lt;br&gt;
stranger-filled subway rides, in &lt;br&gt;
hands warmer than yours, in &lt;br&gt;
rain pouring down the gorge &lt;br&gt;
through whitewashed towns you couldn't name &lt;br&gt;
nor remember  &lt;br&gt;
washing away the dust, for once giving me &lt;br&gt;
clean air to breathe   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;six. lightening strike  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;maybe it's just my mind&lt;br&gt;
regressing 
memory under reconstruction&lt;br&gt;
of once-perfect moments &lt;br&gt;
staring into your eyes under your sheets &lt;br&gt;
by the creek, hands on my skin &lt;br&gt;
now I wince at the cold &lt;br&gt;
your hearth scorches &lt;br&gt;
your shelter from the storm&lt;br&gt;
became a prison &lt;br&gt;
you forgot to wear gloves when you caught this falcon &lt;br&gt;
her claws draw blood &lt;br&gt;
her heart yearns for the skies   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So forgive me if I no longer respond &lt;br&gt;
if I can't tell you that I love you &lt;br&gt;
I've shredded the love letters &lt;br&gt;
burned the past &lt;br&gt;
swept the ashes into the street &lt;br&gt;
let the the rain wash it away  &lt;br&gt;
the water set me free   &lt;/p&gt;</description><category>leaving</category><category>love</category><category>poetry</category><guid>https://junypr.github.io/junypr-berries/posts/lightning-heartbeat/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 23 Oct 2024 00:03:43 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
