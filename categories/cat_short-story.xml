Not the two-week business-trip and visiting-family kind of leaving. Not leaving for good, either. You were there one bleak morning, waving goodbye to me through the security lines, steel-gray suitcase and backpack in hand, then gone. House empty. Peaceful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, you and mother call every night. Then every week. Then almost never. The whispers become more like empty screams and I think I hear the phone ring, my mother not picking up, your voice calling for me, me not picking up. I don’t like hearing the screams. I can’t make out the words, but I know what screaming means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We visited your Shanghai apartment that summer, and I remember the drip of chocolate-dipped ice cream cones, the fan thinly fighting the heat, the plastic covering of the bed that wasn’t my own. I dreamed that blood was pouring from every pore in my skin that night, into the fabric of a foreign-not-foreign country that I can and can’t call my home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I was seven when you made the business arrangement. Half your year here, with us, half your year there, in the country I knew in my blood but had never seen. Part-time father, my brother called it. I didn’t know what part-time meant. Or maybe he didn’t.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I draw sketches of you from faded yellow photos, to give when you return. Mother says I’m quite good. A natural-born artist.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;She stared from the hemp hammock with silver eyes matching mine. Except there wasn’t a star burning within, just the leaden shine of the three moons through the hut’s reed roof. She resembled me, it was true. The same abyssal hair flecked with stars, the same galaxial swirls dancing across her skin. Even the same flowing robes licked with violet flames, woven from the gasps of a dying star.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The villager with the sun-washed chest and shell-bead necklace smiled. “She told us to expect you.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Expect me?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It started with darkness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s dark in the space between the stars. It’s dark, and it’s cold, and it’s empty, and it’s where I go to clear my head. I float, where time and space freeze, watching the planets hum their endless melodies, watching newborn stars gasp their first breaths or dying ones scream their last. When I tire of the infinite lights, I close my eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My name is Eva Cloudstrider, I mold the fabric of space and time, and I don’t know why I’m here. Maybe if I listen long enough, I’ll find out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All I hear is a scream. A scream that winds around me until I’m caught in its embrace. A scream that tugs, ever stronger, until I take a step and time spins and spools and falls away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m on a beach. The sand like stars again skin darker than the end of time, the waves a kiss upon milky cheeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scream is louder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scream is death.&lt;/p&gt;
