                        <p>Accident was the yellow-black taxi stopped <br>
at your workshop. Heart-stopped —  <br>
it wasn’t my studio. Heartless  <br>
December snow trampled into metal chips <br>
under your boots. Paint chips  <br>
under my nails. You liked them. <br>
Maybe you’d like them painted. <br>
Chance was the storm keeping me with you.  <br>
No excuse. You handed me pliers,  <br>
a wrench. Taught me to weld like maybe I’d mend  <br>
your broken heart. Broken engine part.  <br>
Rose was the flush of your cheeks  <br>
when I brushed you. Breath-caught beauty, <br>
that in building two men  <br>
can be uncomfortably close. Beauty, <br>
in being comfortingly close. <br>
When the storm cleared <br>
you bloomed like a rose in the painting  <br>
I made of your crimson-navy swirls  <br>
indigo splatters and flecks of white.  <br>
In attic sunlight, gauze curtains drawn, <br>
you were my masterpiece. I, the mastermind.  <br>
Maybe I loaded the dice. Maybe weighted coins land  <br>
headfirst. Maybe I was sprinting headfirst <br>
to keep you by my side. <br>
And if I smelled like machine grease,  <br>
and you did too.  <br>
And if you smelled like acrylic paint,  <br>
and I did too. <br>
It would only be coincidence.    </p>

                        <p>one. couple in worn-out jeans who'd drive a Jeep with the doors 
torn off and paint their walls lime green to piss off the neighbors. 
the man upends a bag of sandwich crumbs, shoos the ducks back their 
side of the fence with steel-toed boot stomps. simple equation: good 
fences equal good neighbors. the ducks slide underneath. </p>
<p>two. mother who mistook you for a proper chinese child who learned 
their mother tongue in the crib like hers, now in college. hao ya zi. 
awkward american accent: yeah. </p>
<p>three. not-man-not-woman-not-neither-maybe-all-of-the-above. cropped 
blonde hair makes them look like your colead. olive bomber jacket, lanky 
legs, might be your classmate. someone from your past. who you want to 
be in the future. they run like they're being tailed. maybe by you.</p>
<p>four. young couple, not holding hands, but she bumps against him, the cuff 
of her sleek leather jacket touching his jeans. he is forgettable beyond 
belief, your eyes slide to the ducks crossing the sidewalk. her black hair 
is pulled into a stubby ponytail, she looks like the photos of you. you 
follow. you never see her face, but you don't want to, you think. in case 
she looks like you.</p>

                        <p>My mother said the changing autumn leaves filled her with melancholy <br>
perhaps that is why she chose California  <br>
where summer slips into winter in ever dimming shades of green  <br>
like a photo drained of color until nothing is left but grey <br>
so smoothly that one never stops to realize the moment  <br>
in which what was had is no longer what you have   </p>
<p>But here I hurtle towards the brink of winter <br>
desperate to hold onto these last moments in the sun   <br>
watching it sink through my open window  <br>
so painfully aware of what I have  <br>
and am soon to lose <br>
it falls.</p>
<p>So I watch sunlight illuminate patches of a bride's dress <br>
pinkies reaching, interlocking, a wedding ring  <br>
hands pressed palm to palm, a girl speaks Spanish on the phone  <br>
a blushing leaf flutters like a yellow swallowtail <br>
the toddler doesn't quite catch it <br>
it falls.</p>
<p>The breeze swirls the leaves like a painter's brush  <br>
I want to dance a dance of grief   <br>
sun over the Charles glows golden through the clouds  <br>
and warm on the back of my neck  <br>
crabapple nestled in the leaves <br>
it falls. </p>
<p>I observe like I did this morning through glass <br>
when the face I saw while folding laundry smiled back and waved <br>
and I tried to catch him on the stairs but was too late <br>
I see you. I know you.<br>
I am here. I tell myself I belong. <br>
it's fall. </p>

                        <p>When I came here I thought I'd <br>
fall in love again --- I mean <br>
read the blogs, hear the babies, hold the healed hearts <br>
and you'd think it'd be the same --- but<br>
I didn't think I'd fall in love with this sense of place<br>
Some home we have <br>
Killian in the afternoon on this statue <br>
of frozen granite speckled by  <br>
the last rays of this summer's sun who we'll  <br>
bid adieu in a few short hours <br>
unprepared for the drudge through icy darkness, and <br>
infinite corridors and labyrinthine tunnels and <br>
maybe it's silly to be in love with a space <br>
that belongs to so many before and after, but <br>
sometimes I walk <br>
and smile <br>
as if gold's been poured into my heart and<br>
perhaps there's no reason for this but<br>
that's love isn't it?<br>
we never know why we do.<br>
and I think I can close my eyes at night<br>
and listen to the harmony of the spheres<br>
out there in that velvety infinite <br>
and inside my chest  <br>
everything feels right   </p>
